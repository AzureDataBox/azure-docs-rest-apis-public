Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with \".\" it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \\ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
