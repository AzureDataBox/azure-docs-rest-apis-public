### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Updates the password and expiration time of a user account on the specified compute node. This operation replaces of all the updateable properties of the account. For example, if the expiryTime element is not specified, the current value is replaced with the default value, not left unmodified. You can update a user account on a node only when it is in the idle or running state.

    description: The password is required for Windows nodes (those created with 'cloudServiceConfiguration', or created with 'virtualMachineConfiguration' using a Windows image reference).
