### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Updates the properties of the specified pool. This fully replaces all the updateable properties of the pool. For example, if the pool has a start task associated with it and if start task is not specified with this request, then the Batch service will remove the existing start task.

  - in: body
    isRequired: true
    description: This list replaces any existing certificate references configured on the pool. If you specify an empty collection, any existing certificate references are removed from the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
    types:
    - uid: CertificateReference
    name: certificateReferences
  - in: body
    isRequired: true
    description: The list replaces any existing application package references on the pool. Changes to application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If omitted, or if you specify an empty collection, any existing application packages references are removed from the pool.
    types:
    - uid: ApplicationPackageReference
    name: applicationPackageReferences
  - in: body
    isRequired: true
    description: This list replaces any existing metadata configured on the pool. If omitted, or if you specify an empty collection, any existing metadata is removed from the pool.

definitions:
- name: StartTask
  description: A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.
  kind: object
  properties:
  - description: The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: commandLine
  - description: When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.
    types:
    - uid: TaskContainerSettings

  - description: Files listed under this element are located in the task's working directory.

  - description: If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.
    types:
    - uid: UserIdentity
    name: userIdentity
  - description: The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
    types:
    - uid: integer
    name: maxTaskRetryCount
  - description: If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.

  - description: The default value is currentuser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
