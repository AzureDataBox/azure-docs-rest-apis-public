### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Updates the properties of the specified pool. This only replaces the pool properties specified in the request. For example, if the pool has a start task associated with it, and a request does not specify a start task element, then the pool keeps the existing start task.

    description: If this element is present, it replaces any existing certificate references configured on the pool. If omitted, any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

    description: Changes to application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any existing application package references. If you specify an empty collection, then all application package references are removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing application package references are left unchanged.
