### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Gets the result of evaluating an automatic scaling formula on the pool. This API is primarily for validating an autoscale formula, as it simply returns the result without applying the formula to the pool. The pool must have auto scaling enabled in order to evaluate a formula.
