### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Lists the usage metrics, aggregated by pool across individual time intervals, for the specified account. If you do not specify a $filter clause including a poolId, the response includes all pools that existed in the account in the time range of the returned aggregation intervals. If you do not specify a $filter clause including a startTime or endTime these filters default to the start and end times of the last aggregation interval currently available; that is, only the last aggregation interval is returned.

      The size of virtual machines in the pool. All VMs in a pool are the same size.

      For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, STANDARD_A1_V2 and STANDARD_A2_V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
