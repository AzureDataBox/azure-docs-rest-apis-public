When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job.

Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with \".\" it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*).

The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

  - description: If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
