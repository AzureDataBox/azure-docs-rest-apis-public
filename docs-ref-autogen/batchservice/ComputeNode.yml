- summary: Adds a user account to the specified compute node. You can add a user account to a node only when it is in the idle or running state.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.adduser
- summary: Deletes a user account from the specified compute node. You can delete a user account to a node only when it is in the idle or running state.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.deleteuser
- summary: Disables task scheduling on the specified compute node. You can disable task scheduling on a node only if its current scheduling state is enabled.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.disablescheduling
- summary: Enables task scheduling on the specified compute node. You can enable task scheduling on a node only if its current scheduling state is disabled
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.enablescheduling
- summary: Gets information about the specified compute node.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.get
- summary: Gets the Remote Desktop Protocol file for the specified compute node. Before you can access a node by using the RDP file, you must create a user account on the node. This API can only be invoked on pools created with a cloud service configuration. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, see the GetRemoteLoginSettings API.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.getremotedesktop
- summary: Gets the settings required for remote login to a compute node. Before you can remotely login to a node using the remote login settings, you must create a user account on the node. This API can be invoked only on pools created with the virtual machine configuration property. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, see the GetRemoteDesktop API.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.getremoteloginsettings
- summary: Lists the compute nodes in the specified pool.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.list
- summary: Restarts the specified compute node. You can restart a node only if it is in an idle or running state.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.reboot
- summary: Reinstalls the operating system on the specified compute node. You can reinstall the operating system on a node only if it is in an idle or running state. This API can be invoked only on pools created with the cloud service configuration property.
  uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.reimage
- summary: Updates the password and expiration time of a user account on the specified compute node. This operation replaces of all the updateable properties of the account. For example, if the expiryTime element is not specified, the current value is replaced with the default value, not left unmodified. You can update a user account on a node only when it is in the idle or running state.
