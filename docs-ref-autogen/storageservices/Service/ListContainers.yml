  types:
  - uid: string
- name: prefix
  in: query
  description: Filters the results to return only containers whose name begins with the specified prefix.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: marker
  in: query
  description: A string value that identifies the portion of the list of containers to be returned with the next listing operation. The operation returns the NextMarker value within the response body if the listing operation did not return all containers remaining to be listed with the current page. The NextMarker value can be used as the value for the marker parameter in a subsequent call to request the next page of list items. The marker value is opaque to the client.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: maxresults
  in: query
  description: Specifies the maximum number of containers to return. If the request does not specify maxresults, or specifies a value greater than 5000, the server will return up to 5000 items. Note that if the listing operation crosses a partition boundary, then the service will return a continuation token for retrieving the remainder of the results. For this reason, it is possible that the service will return fewer results than specified by maxresults, or than the default of 5000.
