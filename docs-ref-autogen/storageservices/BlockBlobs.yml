operations:
- uid: storageservices.blockblobs.getblocklist
  summary: The Get Block List operation retrieves the list of blocks that have been uploaded as part of a block blob
- uid: storageservices.blockblobs.putblock
  summary: The Put Block operation creates a new block to be committed as part of a blob
- uid: storageservices.blockblobs.putblocklist
  summary: The Put Block List operation writes a blob by specifying the list of block IDs that make up the blob. In order to be written as part of a blob, a block must have been successfully written to the server in a prior Put Block operation. You can call Put Block List to update a blob by uploading only those blocks that have changed, then committing the new and existing blocks together. You can do this by specifying whether to commit a block from the committed block list or from the uncommitted block list, or to commit the most recently uploaded version of the block, whichever list it may belong to.
