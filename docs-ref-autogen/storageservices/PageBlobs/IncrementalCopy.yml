summary: The Incremental Copy Blob operation copies a snapshot of the source page blob to a destination page blob. The snapshot is copied such that only the differential changes between the previously copied snapshot are transferred to the destination. The copied snapshots are complete copies of the original snapshot and can be read or copied from as usual. This API is supported since REST version 2016-05-31.
