summary: Returns a collection of machines matching the specified conditions.  The returned collection represents either machines that are active/live during the specified interval  of time (`live=true` and `startTime`/`endTime` are specified) or that are known to have existed at or  some time prior to the specified point in time (`live=false` and `timestamp` is specified).
