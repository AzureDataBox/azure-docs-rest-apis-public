### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Returns a collection of machines matching the specified conditions.  The returned collection represents either machines that are active/live during the specified interval  of time (`live=true` and `startTime`/`endTime` are specified) or that are known to have existed at or  some time prior to the specified point in time (`live=false` and `timestamp` is specified).

  description: A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored machines. As machines change, prior versions of the machine resource are preserved and available for access. A machine is live during an interval of time, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of that interval, or a Dependency agent running on other machines has reported activity associated with the machine.
