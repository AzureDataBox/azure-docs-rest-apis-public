  description: A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored machines. As machines change, prior versions of the machine resource are preserved and available for access. A machine is live during an interval of time, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of that interval, or a Dependency agent running on other machines has reported activity associated with the machine.
