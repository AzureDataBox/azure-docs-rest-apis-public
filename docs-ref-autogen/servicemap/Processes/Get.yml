  description: A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process may be actively *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine, or *discovered*, i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored machines. A process resource represents a pool of actual operating system resources that share command lines and metadata. As the process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource are preserved and available for access. A process is live during an interval of time, if that process is executing during (parts) of that interval
