### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Deletes a key of any type from storage in Azure Key Vault. The delete key operation cannot be used to remove individual versions of a key. This operation removes the cryptographic material associated with the key, which means the key is not usable for Sign/Verify, Wrap/Unwrap or Encrypt/Decrypt operations.
