  summary: In some cases, a fuzzy search might be too much.  For example, if you are only interested in traditional geocoding, Address Search can be used for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The search index will be queried for everything above the street level data and no POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.
