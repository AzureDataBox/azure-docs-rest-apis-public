# `management.azure.com.resourcemanagement.policyassignments.createbyid`

## `summary`
Creates a policy assignment by ID. Policy assignments are inherited by child resources. For example, when you apply a policy to a resource group that policy is assigned to all resources in the group. When providing a scope for the assigment, use '/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/' for subscriptions, '/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}' for resource groups, and '/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider-namespace}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}' for resources.
