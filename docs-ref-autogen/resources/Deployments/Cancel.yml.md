# `management.azure.com.resourcemanagement.deployments.cancel`

## `summary`
Cancels a currently running template deployment. You can cancel a deployment only if the provisioningState is Accepted or Running. After the deployment is canceled, the provisioningState is set to Canceled. Canceling a template deployment stops the currently running template deployment and leaves the resource group partially deployed.
