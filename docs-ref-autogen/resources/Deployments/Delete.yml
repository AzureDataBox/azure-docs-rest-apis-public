### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Deletes a deployment from the deployment history. A template deployment that is currently running cannot be deleted. Deleting a template deployment removes the associated deployment operations. Deleting a template deployment does not affect the state of the resource group. This is an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the template deployment is successfully deleted. The Location response header contains the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process is running, a call to the URI in the Location header returns a status of 202. When the process finishes, the URI in the Location header returns a status of 204 on success. If the asynchronous request failed, the URI in the Location header returns an error-level status code.
