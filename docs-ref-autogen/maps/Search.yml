- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchaddress
  summary: '**Address Geocoding**<br><br>In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if you are only interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocode endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above the street level data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchaddressreverse
  summary: '**Reverse Geocode to an Address**<br><br>There may be times when you need to translate a coordinate (example: 37.786505, -122.3862) into a human understandable street address. Most often this is needed in tracking applications where you receive a GPS feed from the device or asset and wish to know what address where the coordinate is located. This endpoint will return address information for a given coordinate.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchaddressreversecrossstreet
  summary: '**Reverse Geocode to a Cross Street**<br><br>There may be times when you need to translate a coordinate (example: 37.786505, -122.3862) into a human understandable cross street. Most often this is needed in tracking applications where you receive a GPS feed from the device or asset and wish to know what address where the coordinate is located.<br><br>This endpoint will return cross street information for a given coordinate.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchaddressstructured
  summary: '**Structured Address Geocoding**<br><br>Azure Address Geocoding can also be accessed for structured address look up exclusively. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above the street level data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchfuzzy
  summary: "**Free Form Search**<br><br>The basic default API is Free Form Search which handles the most fuzzy of inputs handling any combination of address or POI tokens. This search API is the canonical 'single line search'. The Free Form Search API is a seamless combination of POI search and geocoding. The API can also be weighted with a contextual position (lat./lon. pair), or fully constrained by a coordinate and radius, or it can be executed more generally without any geo biasing anchor point.<br><br>We strongly advise you to use the 'countrySet' parameter to specify only the countries for which your application needs coverage, as the default behavior will be to search the entire world, potentially returning unnecessary results.<br><br> E.g.: `countrySet`=US,FR <br><br>Please see [Search Coverage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage) for a complete list of all the supported countries.<br><br>Most Search queries default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and also reduce unusual results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the query param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4."
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchnearby
  summary: '**Nearby Search**<br><br>If you have a use case for only retrieving POI results around a specific location, the nearby search method may be the right choice. This endpoint will only return POI results, and does not take in a search query parameter.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchpoi
  summary: '**Get POI by Name**<br><br>If your search use case only requires POI results, you may use the POI endpoint for searching. This endpoint will only return POI results.'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.getsearchpoicategory
  summary: '**Get POI by Category**<br><br>If your search use case only requires POI results filtered by category, you may use the category endpoint. This endpoint will only return POI results which are categorized as specified.<br><br>List of available categories can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/search-categories).'
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.postsearchalongroute
  summary: The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for POIs along a specified route. This search is constrained by specifying the `maxDetourTime` limiting measure.<br><br>To send the route-points you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `route` object represented as a `GeoJSON LineString` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Each route-point in `route` is represented as a `GeoJSON Position` type i.e. an array where the _longitude_ value is followed by the _latitude_ value and the _altitude_ value is ignored. The `route` should contain at least 2 route-points.<br><br>It is possible that original route will be altered, some of it's points may be skipped. If the route that passes through the found point is faster than the original one, the `detourTime` value in the response is negative.
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.postsearchinsidegeometry
  summary: The Search Geometry endpoint allows you to perform a free form search inside a single geometry or many of them. The search results that fall inside the geometry/geometries will be returned.<br><br>To send the geometry you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `geometry` object represented as a `GeoJSON` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. The geographical features to be searched can be modeled as Polygon and/or Circle geometries represented using any one of the following `GeoJSON` types:<ul><li>**GeoJSON FeatureCollection** <br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains both Polygons and Circles. The `FeatureCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects. Each `Feature` object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle with the following conditions:<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>A `Feature` object for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates and it's properties must be empty.</li><li>A `Feature` object for the Circle geometry is composed of a _center_ represented using a `GeoJSON Point` type and a _radius_ value (in meters) which must be specified in the object's properties along with the _subType_ property whose value should be 'Circle'.</li></ul><br> Please see the Examples section below for a sample `FeatureCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON GeometryCollection**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON GeometryCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a list of Polygons only. The `GeometryCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon` objects. Each `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the Examples section below for a sample `GeometryCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON Polygon**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON Polygon` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a single Polygon. The `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the Examples section below for a sample `Polygon` representation.<br><br></li></ul>.<br><br>
