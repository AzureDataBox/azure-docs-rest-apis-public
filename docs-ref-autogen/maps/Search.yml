  summary: In some cases, a fuzzy search might be too much. For example, if you are only interested in traditional geocoding, Address Search can be used for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The search index will be queried for everything above the street level data and no POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.

  summary: >-
    The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for POIs along a specified route. This search is constrained by specifying detour time limiting measure.


    To send the route points you will use a POST request where the request body will contain the route parameter in JSON format. The minimum number of route points is 2. It is possible that original route will be altered, some of its points may be skipped. If the route that passes through the found point is faster than the original one, the detour time value is negative. POST requests require the "Content-Type" header to be set to "application/json"
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.search.searchinsidegeometry
  summary: >-
    The geometry search endpoint allows you to perform a free form search inside a single geometry or many of them. The search results that fall inside the geometry/geometries will be returned.


    Available geometry types are Polygon and Circle. The geometry should be provided as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection. The FeatureCollection can contain a Max of 50 GeoJSON Feature objects. Each Feature object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle. A Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates. A Feature object for the Circle geometry must contain the radius value (in meters) in the object's properties.


    To send the geometry you will use a POST/GET request with the JSON as a string value for the geometryList parameter, POST is recommended for large datasets. POST requests require the "Content-Type" header to be set to "application/json"
