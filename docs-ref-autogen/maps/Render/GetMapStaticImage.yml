name: Get Map Static Image
service: Maps
groupName: Render
apiVersion: "1.0"
summary: >-
  The static image service renders a user-defined, rectangular image containing a map section using a zoom level from 0 to 20.


  The supported resolution range for the map image is from 1x1 to 8192x8192.


  If you are deciding when to use the static image service over the map tile service, you may want to consider how you would like to interact with the rendered map. If the map contents will be relatively unchanging, a static map is a good choice. If you want to support a lot of zooming, panning and changing of the map content, the map tile service would be a better choice.


  __Note__ : Either __center__ or __bbox__ parameter must be supplied to the API.
