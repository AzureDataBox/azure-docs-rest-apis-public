summary: "**Route Directions Batch API**<br><br> The Route Directions Batch API allows the caller to batch up to 1000 [Route Directions API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/routeservice/getroutedirections) queries/requests using just a single api call. To send the _route directions_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `queries` array in `JSON` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`.<br><br>An _route directions_ query in a batch is just a partial URL without the protocol, base URL, path, api-version and subscription-key. All these values will be reused from the Route Directions Batch API call itself. The string values in the _route directions_ query must be properly escaped (e.g. \" character should be escaped with \\\\) and it should also be properly URL-encoded.<br><br> for example: \"?_query_=47.639987,-122.128384:47.621252,-122.184408:47.596437,-122.332000&_routeType_=fastest&_travelMode_=car\"<br><br> The maximum number of queries that can be specified in the batch is 1000 and the batch should contain at least 1 query.<br><br>Please note that the Route Directions Batch API is a long-running request. When the client `POST`'s the initial batch request, the server responds immediately with a `202 Accepted` response with the `Location` header containing the URL to download the results of the batch request later. To download the batch results you will issue a `GET` request to this download endpoint. If the batch processing has finished, this call returns a `200 OK` response with all the batch results, else it continues to return a `202 Accepted` response. Please, be aware that batch results are available for download for 14 days, after which the request for results download will return `400 Bad Request` response."
