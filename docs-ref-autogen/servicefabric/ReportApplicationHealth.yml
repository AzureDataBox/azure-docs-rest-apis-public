  summary: "Sends a health report on the Service Fabric application.  \nReports health state of the specified Service Fabric application. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported.\nThe report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.\nThe report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation.\nFor example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number.\nTo see whether the report was applied in the health store, get application health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section."
