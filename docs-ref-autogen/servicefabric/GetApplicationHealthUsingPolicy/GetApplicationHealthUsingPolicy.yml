    Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.

    The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.

    Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.

    If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.


    - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

    - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.


      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

      When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information

      When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters.

      If set to true, the report is remopved from the health store after it expires.

      If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default.

      When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default).

      This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.
