    Gets the next segment of the Chaos report based on the passed-in continuation token or the passed-in time-range. You can either specify the ContinuationToken to get the next segment of the Chaos report or you can specify the time-range

    through StartTimeUtc and EndTimeUtc, but you cannot specify both the ContinuationToken and the time-range in the same call.

    When there are more than 100 Chaos events, the Chaos report is returned in segments where a segment contains no more than 100 Chaos events.
