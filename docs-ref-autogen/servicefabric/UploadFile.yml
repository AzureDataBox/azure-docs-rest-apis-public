  summary: "Uploads contents of the file to the image store.  \nUploads contents of the file to the image store. Use this API if the file is small enough to upload again if the connection fails. The file's data needs to be added to the request body. The contents will be uploaded to the specified path. Image store service uses a mark file to indicate the availability of the folder. The mark file is an empty file named \"_.dir\". The mark file is generated by the image store service when all files in a folder are uploaded. When using File-by-File approach to upload application package in REST, the image store service isn't aware of the file hierarchy of the application package; you need to create a mark file per folder and upload it last, to let the image store service know that the folder is complete."
