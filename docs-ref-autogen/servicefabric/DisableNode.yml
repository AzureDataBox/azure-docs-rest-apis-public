  summary: "Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent.  \nDeactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent. Once the deactivation is in progress, the deactivation intent can be increased, but not decreased (for example, a node which is was deactivated with the Pause intent can be deactivated further with Restart, but not the other way around. Nodes may be reactivated using the Activate a node operation any time after they are deactivated. If the deactivation is not complete this will cancel the deactivation. A node which goes down and comes back up while deactivated will still need to be reactivated before services will be placed on that node."
