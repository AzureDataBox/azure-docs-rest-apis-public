  summary: "Deletes an existing Service Fabric service.  \nDeletes an existing Service Fabric service. A service must be created before it can be deleted. By default, Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However, if the service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the service."
