    The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.2'.


    Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This version is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.


    Additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.


      In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

    description: >-

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications. Default percentage is zero.
    types:

    description: >-
      Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific application types.

      Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.


      The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe special application types.

      The application types included in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.

      The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted against the global pool of applications.

      For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type

      and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).

      All other applications can be evaluated with MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances.

      The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.

    of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is not possible to specify "fault this application only when it is on that node type."

    Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if

    applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos iteration applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of nodeTypeY that is included

      However, if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement constraints and applicationX is absent from ApplicationInclusionList and nodeTypeY is absent from NodeTypeInclusionList, then applicationX will never be faulted.
