  description: >-
    The identity of the service. This is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric:' URI scheme.

    Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character.

    For example, if the service name is "fabric:/myapp/app1/svc1", the service identity would be "myapp~app1~svc1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous versions.

    The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.


    Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.


    Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

    Key type for the partition. This parameter is required if the partition scheme for the service is Int64Range or Named. The possible values are following.

    - None (1) - Indicates that the PartitionKeyValue parameter is not specified. This is valid for the partitions with partitioning scheme as Singleton. This is the default value. The value is 1.

    - Int64Range (2) - Indicates that the PartitionKeyValue parameter is an int64 partition key. This is valid for the partitions with partitioning scheme as Int64Range. The value is 2.

    - Named (3) - Indicates that the PartitionKeyValue parameter is a name of the partition. This is valid for the partitions with partitioning scheme as Named. The value is 3.
