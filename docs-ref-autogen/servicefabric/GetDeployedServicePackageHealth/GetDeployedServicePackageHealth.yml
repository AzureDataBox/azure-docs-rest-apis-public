    The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.


    Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.


    Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
  types:
  - uid: ApiVersion_6-0_RequiredQueryParam
- name: EventsHealthStateFilter
  in: query
  description: >-
    Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.

    The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.

    Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.

    If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.


    - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

    - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

    - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

    - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

    - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

    - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

    description: >-
      The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.


      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

  - name: TimeToLiveInMilliSeconds
    description: >-
      The duration for which this health report is valid. This field uses ISO8601 format for specifying the duration.

      When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live.

      If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite.

      When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information

      is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.


      If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Description
    description: >-
      The description of the health information. It represents free text used to add human readable information about the report.

      The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters.

      If the provided string is longer, it will be automatically truncated.

      When truncated, the last characters of the description contain a marker "[Truncated]", and total string size is 4096 characters.

      The presence of the marker indicates to users that truncation occurred.

      Note that when truncated, the description has less than 4096 characters from the original string.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: SequenceNumber
    description: >-
      The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string.

      The report sequence number is used by the health store to detect stale reports.

      If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client when a report is added.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: RemoveWhenExpired
    description: >-
      Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires.

      If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it expires.

      If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default.

      When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default).

      This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.

      This flags the entity as being in Error health state.

It is used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the ID. If a stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will get a different value for the ID.
