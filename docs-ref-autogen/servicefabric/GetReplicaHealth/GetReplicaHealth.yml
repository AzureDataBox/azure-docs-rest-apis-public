  Gets the health of a Service Fabric stateful service replica or stateless service instance. Gets the health of a Service Fabric replica.

  Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the replica based on the health state.

  description: >
    Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.

    The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.

    Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.

    If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.


    - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

    - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

    - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.

    - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.

    - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

    - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.


      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.
