    Starts or stops a cluster node. Starts or stops a cluster node.  A cluster node is a process, not the OS instance itself.  To start a node, pass in "Start" for the NodeTransitionType parameter.

    To stop a node, pass in "Stop" for the NodeTransitionType parameter.  This API starts the operation - when the API returns the node may not have finished transitioning yet.

    Call GetNodeTransitionProgress with the same OperationId to get the progress of the operation.
