It is used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the id. If a staless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will get a different value for the id.
