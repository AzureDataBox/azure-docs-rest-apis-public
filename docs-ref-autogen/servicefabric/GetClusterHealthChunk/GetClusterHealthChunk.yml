    The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.


    Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.


    Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.

    description: Id of a stateful service replica or a stateless service instance. This ID is used in the queries that apply to both stateful and stateless services. It is used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the ID. If a stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will get a different value for the ID.
