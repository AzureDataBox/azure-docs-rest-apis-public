  summary: >
    Creates a new repair task. For clusters that have the Repair Manager Service configured,

    this API provides a way to create repair tasks that run automatically or manually.

    For repair tasks that run automatically, an appropriate repair executor

    must be running for each repair action to run automatically.

    These are currently only available in specially-configured Azure Cloud Services.


    To create a manual repair task, provide the set of impacted node names and the

    expected impact. When the state of the created repair task changes to approved,

    you can safely perform repair actions on those nodes.


    This API supports the Service Fabric platform; it is not meant to be used directly from your code.
