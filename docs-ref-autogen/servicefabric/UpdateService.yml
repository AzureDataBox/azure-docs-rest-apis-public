  summary: "Updates a Service Fabric service using the specified update description.  \nThis API allows updating properties of a running Service Fabric service. The set of properties that can be updated are a subset of the properties that were specified at the time of creating the service. The current set of properties can be obtained using `GetServiceDescription` API. Please note that updating the properties of a running service is different than upgrading your application using `StartApplicationUpgrade` API. The upgrade is a long running background operation that involves moving the application from one version to another, one upgrade domain at a time, whereas update applies the new properties immediately to the service."
