  summary: "Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest.  \nGet the Service Fabric cluster manifest. The cluster manifest contains properties of the cluster that include different node types on the cluster,\nsecurity configurations, fault and upgrade domain topologies, etc.\n\nThese properties are specified as part of the ClusterConfig.JSON file while deploying a stand alone cluster. However, most of the information in the cluster manifest\nis generated internally by service fabric during cluster deployment in other deployment scenarios (e.g. when using azure portal).\n\nThe contents of the cluster manifest are for informational purposes only and users are not expected to take a dependency on the format of the file contents or its interpretation."
