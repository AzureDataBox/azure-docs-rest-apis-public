  summary: >
    Gets the health of the specified Service Fabric partition, by using the specified health policy. Gets the health information of the specified partition.

    If the application health policy is specified, the health evaluation uses it to get the aggregated health state.

    If the policy is not specified, the health evaluation uses the application health policy defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in the manifest.

    Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the partition based on the health state.

    Use ReplicasHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of ReplicaHealthState objects on the partition. Use ApplicationHealthPolicy in the POST body to override the health policies used to evaluate the health.

    If you specify a partition that does not exist in the health store, this cmdlet returns an error.
