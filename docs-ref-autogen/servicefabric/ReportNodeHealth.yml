  summary: >
    Sends a health report on the Service Fabric node. Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported.

    The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the health store.

    The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation.

    For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number.

    To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetNodeHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.
