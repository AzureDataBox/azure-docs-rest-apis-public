### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: >
  Sends a health report on the Service Fabric partition. Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric partition. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported.

  The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Partition, which forwards to the health store.

  The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation.

  For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number.

  To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetPartitionHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

    A flag which indicates whether the report should be sent immediately.

    A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which forwards to the health store.

    If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from Http Gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the Http Gateway Application is using.

    This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.

    Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the Http Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the Gateway.

    If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the Http Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.

    This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.

    By default, reports are not sent immediately.

      The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.


      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

      When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information

      is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.
