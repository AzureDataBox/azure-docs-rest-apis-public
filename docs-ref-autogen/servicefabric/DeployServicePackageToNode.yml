  summary: "Downloads all of the code packages associated with specified service manifest on the specified node.  \nThis API provides a way to download code packages including the container images on a specific node outside of the normal application deployment and upgrade path. This is useful for the large code packages and container images to be present on the node before the actual application deployment and upgrade, thus significantly reducing the total time required for the deployment or upgrade."
