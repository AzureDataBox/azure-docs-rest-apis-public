  summary: >
    Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. The health evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query description.

    The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children.

    Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.

    The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return

    only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.
