  summary: >-
    Get tagged images for a given project iteration This API supports batching and range selection. By default it will only return first 50 images matching images.

    Use the {take} and {skip} parameters to control how many images to return in a given batch.

    The filtering is on an and/or relationship. For example, if the provided tag ids are for the "Dog" and

    "Cat" tags, then only images tagged with Dog and/or Cat will be returned
