  properties:
  - description: The deviceId uniquely identifies the device in the IoT hub's identity registry. A case-sensitive string (up to 128 char long) of ASCII 7-bit alphanumeric chars + {'-', ':', '.', '+', '%', '_', '#', '*', '?', '!', '(', ')', ',', '=', '@', ';', '$', '''}.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: deviceId
  - isReadyOnly: true
    description: An IoT hub-generated case-sensitive string (up to 128 char long). Used to distinguish devices with the same deviceId when they have been deleted and recreated.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: generationId
  - description: A string representing an ETag for the device identity, as per RFC7232. It is used in the HTTP protocol to resolve conflicting concurrent updates to the properties of this device. An ETag is required when performing an update or delete operation on a device.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: etag
  - description: Specifies the different connection states of a device.
    types:
    - uid: DeviceConnectionState
    name: connectionState
  - description: Represents the current status of a device. A disabled device is not allowed to perform any messaging operation. An IoT hub administrator can choose to enable or disable a device.
    types:
    - uid: DeviceStatus
    name: status
  - description: A string of user metadata. Reason, if any, for the device to be in specified status. Not interpreted or used by the IoT hub
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: statusReason
  - description: Time when the "connectionState" was last updated. In ISO8601 datetime format in UTC, for example, 2015-01-28T16:24:48.789Z
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: connectionStateUpdatedTime
  - description: Time when the "status" was last updated. In ISO8601 datetime format in UTC; for example, 2015-01-28T16:24:48.789Z
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: statusUpdatedTime
  - description: Last time the device connected, received or sent a message. In ISO8601 datetime format in UTC, for example, 2015-01-28T16:24:48.789Z. This does not update if the device uses the HTTP/1 protocol to perform messaging operations.
