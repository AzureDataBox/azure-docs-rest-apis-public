operations:
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.bulkdeviceoperation
  summary: "Create, update, or delete the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry.  \nCreate, update, or delete the identiies of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. A device identity can be specified only once in the list. Different operations (create, update, delete) on different devices are allowed. A maximum of 100 devices can be specified per invocation. For large scale operations, consider using the import feature using blob storage(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#import-and-export-device-identities)."
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.deletedevice
  summary: "Delete the identity of a device from the identity registry of an IoT hub.  \nDelete the identity of a device from the identity registry of an IoT hub. This request requires the If-Match header. The client may specify the ETag for the device identity on the request in order to compare to the ETag maintained by the service for the purpose of optimistic concurrency. The delete operation is performed only if the ETag sent by the client matches the value maintained by the server, indicating that the device identity has not been modified since it was retrieved by the client. To force an unconditional delete, set If-Match to the wildcard character (*)."
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.getdevice
  summary: Retrieve a device from the identity registry of an IoT hub.
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.getdevices
  summary: "Get the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry.  \nGet the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. Returns the specified number of devices from the IoT hub's identity registry. If a limit is not specified, it returns up to 1000 identities. Pagination of device identities is not supported. This API is targeted at development and test scenarios. For large scale operations, consider using the export feature using blob storage(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#import-and-export-device-identities)"
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.getregistrystatistics
  summary: "Retrieves statistics about device identities in the IoT hub’s identity registry.  \nRetrieves statistics about device identities in the IoT hub’s identity registry. The body contains the total number of device identities and a breakdown of the number of devices that are enabled and disabled."
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.getservicestatistics
  summary: "Retrieves service statistics for this IoT hub’s identity registry.  \nRetrieves service statistics for this IoT hub’s identity registry. This returns the total number of devices currently connected to an IoT hub."
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.purgecommandqueue
  summary: Delete all the pending commands for this device from the IoT hub.
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.putdevice
  summary: "Create or update the identity of a device in the identity registry of an IoT hub.  \nCreate or update the identity of a device in the identity registry of an IoT hub. An ETag must not be specified for the create operation. An ETag must be specified for the update operation. Note that generationId and deviceId cannot be updated by the user."
- uid: <fully-qualifiediothubdomainname>.iothub.deviceapi.querydevices
  summary: "Query an IoT hub to retrieve information regarding device twins using a SQL-like language.  \nQuery an IoT hub to retrieve information regarding device twins using a SQL-like language. See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-query-language for more information. Pagination of results is supported. This returns information about device twins only."
