The creation of a virtual machine involves an Azure Storage account and typically resources such as a network interface or availability set. For more information about creating these resources, see:

- [Create a resource group](../../docs-ref-autogen/resources/resourcegroups.json#ResourceGroups_CreateOrUpdate)
- [Create a storage account](../../docs-ref-autogen/storage/storageaccounts.json#StorageAccounts_Create)
- [Create a virtual network](../../docs-ref-autogen/network/virtualnetworks.json#VirtualNetworks_CreateOrUpdate)
- [Create a network interface](../../docs-ref-autogen/network/networkinterfaces.json#NetworkInterfaces_CreateOrUpdate)
- [Create a public IP address](../../docs-ref-autogen/network/publicipaddresses.json#PublicIPAddresses_CreateOrUpdate)
- [Create an availability set](../../docs-ref-autogen/compute/availabilitysets.json#AvailabilitySets_CreateOrUpdate)

For the update scenario, a PUT or PATCH request can be submitted with a subset of the VM properties. Alternatively, the RESTful way is to do a GET, tweak the properties and submit a PUT request. For non-updateable properties, it’s OK to be specify them in Update request but they must have the same values as returned by GET. For examples of different VM configurations, see [VM configurations](vm-configuration.md).
