Imports an existing valid certificate, containing a private key, into Azure Key Vault. The certificate to be imported can be in either PFX or PEM format. If the certificate is in PEM format the PEM file must contain the key as well as x509 certificates.

Following is an example of a supported PEM file format. The file must contain the private key and at least one of x509 certificate corresponding to the private key of the x509 certificate chain.

```PEM
   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
       ...
   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       ...
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       ...
   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

The private key may be encrypted in which case the private key will be inside encrypted private key markers as follows:

```PEM
  -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
       ...
  -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The following PBE SHA1 encryption algorithms, outlined in [RFC7292 - PKCS #12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292#appendix-C), are supported with an encrypted private key:

- pbeWithSha1And128BitRc2
- pbeWithSha1And128BitRc4
- pbeWithSha1And2KeyTripleDes
- pbeWithSha1And3KeyTripleDes
- pbeWithSha1And40BitRc2
- pbeWithSha1And40BitRc

Policy is optional and assumes import of a PFX file. If importing a PEM file, specify the *contentType* as `application/x-pem-file`.

[!NOTE] When a certificate is imported without a specified policy or with a policy that does not have issuer or lifetime action fields specified, the issuer field is set to **unknown** and the *lifetime actions* field is set to **EmailContacts**. This policy can be modified to **AutoRenew** with a named issuer by patching the policy.

See [Common parameters and headers](~/docs-ref-conceptual/keyvault/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests.

In your request:

- Replace `{certificate-name}` with the name of the certificate you want created.

List all versions of a given certificate.

See [Common parameters and headers](~/docs-ref-conceptual/keyvault/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests.

In your request:

- Replace `{certificate-name}` with the name of the certificate for which you want a list of versions.
- Query option `maxresults={maxresults}` is optional. The value of `maxresults` must be a non-negative integer less than 25. If a value out of the range is specified, the request will fail with an Http 400 error. If this query option is not specified, the service will return up to 25 results.

Request body: None, this is an HTTP GET operation.

Set specified members in the certificate policy. Leave others as null.

See [Common parameters and headers](~/docs-ref-conceptual/keyvault/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests.

In your request:

- Replace `{certificate-name}` with the name of the certificate for which you want to update the policy.

Alternate Method: An alternative to using PATCH is to use PUT so, you effect a set / replacement behavior. PATCH will allow you to specify as few as one property in the request such that only that property will be updated. PUT will completely replace the policy. In other words, if you specify all properties with a PATCH method, then it is equivalent to using a PUT method effectively setting all properties of the certificate policy.

The update operation changes non-read-only properties in the attributes or tags of current or specified version of a key vault certificate.

- You may also specificy the `{certificate-version}` of the certificate to update.

Alternate Method: POST with X-HTTP-METHOD header that specifies 
PATCH.
