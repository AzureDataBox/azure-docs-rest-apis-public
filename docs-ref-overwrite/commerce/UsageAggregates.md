    - name: api-version
      description: Use the latest version `2016-06-01-preview`.
    - name: reportedEndTime
      description: An ISO 8601 [dateTimeOffset](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime) value (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+00:00) representing the timestamp at which the resource usage was recorded within the Azure billing system. However, you must specify Reported Time here to ensure you get all usage events reported within a specific time period within the billing system. Even though the query is made with the Reported Time, the usage response is aggregated by the resource Usage Time, which is the useful pivot for callers. To learn more, please see the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions-for-usage-data) section. <b>Important - </b>The value must be URL encoded, replacing special characters with escape codes (i.e. colon is escaped to %3a, plus sign is escaped to %2b) so that it is URI friendly, and must be specified in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).
    - name: reportedstartTime
      description: See reportedEndTime
    - name: aggregationGranularity
      description: This is an optional parameter with two discrete values. `Daily` (default) returns the data in daily granularity, `Hourly` returns the data in hourly granularity.
    - name: continuationToken
      description: This is an optional parameter, used when a continuation token string is provided in the response body of the previous call, enabling paging through a large result set. If not present, the data is retrieved from the beginning of the day/hour (based on the granularity) passed in. 
    - name: showDetails
      description: This is an optional Boolean flag. `True` returns usage data in instance-level detail, `false` causes server-side aggregation with fewer details. For example, if you have 3 website instances, by default you will get 3 line items for website consumption. If you specify showDetails = false, the data will be aggregated as a single line item for website consumption within the time period (for the given subscriptionId, meterId, usageStartTime and usageEndTime).

Enables you to query aggregate Azure subscription consumption data by start and end date/time, aggregation granularity (ie: daily, hourly), and instance level detail if you have multiple instances of the same resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  All usage data incurred on an Azure subscription is returned, not just the usage data that was considered for billing. This may might include any usage at the end of the billing cycle that was discarded due to lateness. Please see the question titled [‘What is the difference between Usage Time and Reported Time?’ in Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions-for-usage-data) for more details.

### Frequently Asked Questions for usage data
| Question | Answer |
|----|----|
|What is the difference between Usage Time and Reported Time?|There are 2 different time concepts involved in understanding consumption data: <br><br><ul><li>**Reported DateTime**: This is the timestamp at which the Azure usage event was recorded in the billing system. This is the timestamp that is used to determine whether a particular usage event made it into a billing cycle, or whether it was dropped due to lateness.</li><li>**Usage DateTime**: This is the timestamp of the actual consumption of the Azure resource.</li><br>At the time of this writing, Azure has 19 Data Centers around the world where customers can run their workloads. Because of this distributed nature, there is a difference between the Usage DateTime and the Reported DateTime for a particular usage event. Although the Azure service providers will move to reporting the usage events at the earliest convenience (every hour), that is not the case today, and there can be multiple hours of delay between the usage DateTime and the reported DateTime for a particular usage event.<br><br>**Please note:** Currently, we allow callers to query by reported DateTime ONLY.|
|Why not just query by Usage Date?|As there can be delay in when the usage events make it into the commerce system (and hence available through this Azure Usage API), querying by usage date can provide incomplete information to callers.<br><br>For example, if a caller queried for usage date of 4/2 on 4/3 for particular resource, he would probably get X units back (X is sum of the usage quantities that were reported by 4/3), but if he made the same query on 4/10, there is a chance that there could be a different number (say Y). If callers took that as deterministic and didn’t check for late usage for usage date 4/2, they would have incomplete information.<br><br>That is why, querying by reported DateTime is deterministic, in that callers can query every hour and deterministically get all the usage events recorded in the billing system in the previous hour, and then keep shifting the reported DateTime parameters forward. The response of the usage events is always aggregated by usage date time, so even though you query by reported Date time, you can get a very good idea of when the particular resources were actually consumed.|
|What does Azure do with late usage? Does it throw it away?|Azure does discard late usage, but the lateness policies are different for different offer types:<br><br>**Typically, a 24-hour lateness period is allowed, but usage that comes in the grace period is billed in the following month.**<br><br><ul><li>Usage for billing period 4/12 – 5/11 reported within the commerce system by 5/12 00:00:00 UTC: Goes on the 5/11 bill to the subscription owner. **Usage is reported on time**.</li><li>Usage for billing period 4/12 – 5/11 reported within the commerce system between 5/12 00:00:00 and 5/13 00:00:00- charge goes on the 6/11 bill to the subscription owner. **Usage is reported within the allowed lateness period but the usage reported within the grace period is moved to the next month’s bill**.</li><li>Usage for billing period 4/12 – 5/11 reported within the commerce system after 5/13 00:00:00 – usage discarded and not considered for billing. **Usage reported after the allowed lateness period, so discarded by the billing system**.</li></ul>Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers have a different behavior- the EA system waits for 5 days to receive all the usage data before they close the previous cycle. Behavior for EA subscriptions is otherwise similar except they have a lateness period of 5 days after the end of the month (1/1 – 1/31, usage accepted till 2/5 UTC).|
|What is the recommended frequency to make calls to the Usage API? |Here is the basic guidance:<br><br><ul><li>**If you query every hour or every day**: you should query every hour/day by reported DateTime and store the data locally according to the usage data. This should be treated as volatile data as this can change with late, incoming usage.</li><li>**If you only query at the end of the billing cycle**: your usage query should be different for different offer types with reported time, and since the usage response is aggregated by usage DateTime, you should discard the usage aggregations that don’t fall into the billing cycle that you are concerned with.</li></ul>|
|What is the difference between the format in the current ‘infoFields’ JSON element in the response body, and the future ‘instanceData’ field?|For each usage aggregate, you will either see infoFields or instanceData. infoFields captures only a subset of the information provided by instanceData (ie: infoFields does not capture resource tags). We are working to move all Azure service providers to the new format to capture and push through more attributes of the usage data. The design moving forward will use instanceData to provide all instance details for the related usage events, which will also support resource groups and tags|
