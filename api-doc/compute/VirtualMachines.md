For the update scenario, a PUT or PATCH request can be submitted with a subset of the VM properties. Alternatively, the RESTful way is to do a GET, tweak the properties and submit a PUT request. For non-updateable properties, itâ€™s OK to be specify them in Update request but they must have the same values as returned by GET. For examples of different VM configurations, see [VM configurations](vm-configuration.md).
