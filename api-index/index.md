# Azure REST API Reference

Welcome to the Azure REST API Reference.

Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which provide create/retrieve/update/delete access to the service's resources. The sections below will walk you through the basics of [REST API request components](#components-of-a-rest-api-request), how to [register an Azure AD client](registering-your-client-application-with-azure-ad) for authentication/authorization, [creating a REST request](creating-the-request), and [handling a REST response](processing-the-response).

## Components of a REST API request/response

The main components of a REST API request can broken down into 3 categories:

- The **URI**, which consists of the following: {URI-scheme} :// {URI-host} / {resource-path} ? {query-string}
    - URI scheme: indicates the protocol used to transmit the request. For example, "http" and "https".  
    - URI host: the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted.  
    - Resource path: specifies the resource or resource collection, which may include parameters used to determine the selection of those resources.
    - Query string (optional): used to provide additional simple parameters, such as the API version, selection criteria, etc.
- HTTP **message header** fields
    - An [HTTP method](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (aka: operation or verb). Azure REST APIs support GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, and PATCH methods.
    - Optional header fields as required by the HTTP method and/or the service endpoint. For example, an Authorization header that provides a bearer token containing client authorization information.
- Optional HTTP **message body** fields, as supported by the HTTP operation. For example, POST operations contain MIME-encoded objects passed as complex parameters. The MIME encoding type for the body must be supplied as well. Note that some services require you to use a specific MIME type, such as "application/json".  

The main components of the response that follows a request include :

- HTTP **message header** fields
    - An [HTTP status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html), ranging from 2xx success codes to 4xx/5xx error codes. Alternatively, a service-defined status code may be returned, as indicated in the API documentation. 
- HTTP **message body** fields
    - MIME-encoded response objects may be returned in the HTTP response body, such as a response from a GET method that is returning data. Many times these will be returned in JSON or XML format. For example, when requesting an access token from Azure AD, it will be returned in the response body as the "access_token" element, one of several name/value paired objects in a data collection.

> For almost all Azure service REST APIs, there is a corresponding client SDK library which handles much of the client code for you. See:
> [Azure .NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api)  
> [Azure Java SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api)  
> [Azure CLI 2.0 SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure)  

## Registering your client application with Azure AD

Many Azure services require your client code to authenticate with valid credentials before you can call the service API, which also allows the service to perform any required authorization. For Azure REST APIs that require authentication (such as the Azure Resource Manager REST APIs), client applications **must** authenticate with Azure Active Directory (AD), and provide proof of the authentication/authorization by passing the resulting OAuth2 bearer token in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent REST API requests. 

Before you begin writing your client's request code, follow the instructions below to register your [client application](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#client-application) with Azure AD. If you've already registered a client application, you can skip to the [Creating the request](#creating-the-request) section. 

1. Azure AD and the OAuth2 Authorization Framework support 2 types of clients. Before you register your application, decide which is the most appropriate for your scenario.:  
    - [confidential/web](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#web-client) clients, which can access resources under either their own identity (ie: a service/daemon), or a signed-in end-user (ie: resource owner) identity.  
    - [public/native](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#native-client) clients (installed on a device) which can only access resources under a signed-in end-user's identity. 
2. Next, refer to one of the articles below, depending on your scenario:
    - To use an Azure Resource Manager API, see [Use portal to create Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/) for step-by-step registration instructions. This article will not only show you how to register the client application with Azure AD, it will also walk you through the steps required by Azure Resource Manager to properly configure it's Role Based Access Control (RBAC) settings for authorizing the client.
    - For all other Azure REST APIs that require an Authorization header, see [Authorize access to web applications using OAuth 2.0 and Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code/)


## Creating the request
2. Modify your client application to pass a bearer token in an Authorization header
    - Authenticate with Azure AD
    - Construct an HTTP Authorization header when calling ARM


[!NOTE] If you prefer to use client libraries to manage token acquisition instead of using the Azure AD REST endpoints. For more details, including reference documentation, library downloads, and sample code, please see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/).

3. Call the REST API

## Processing the response
In the example provided above, we used the /subscriptions endpoint to retrieve the list of subscriptions for our sample client application.
