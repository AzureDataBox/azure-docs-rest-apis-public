# Azure REST API Reference

Welcome to the Azure REST API Reference.

Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which provide create/retrieve/update/delete access to the service's resources. The sections below will first walk you through the basics of [REST API request and response components](#components-of-a-rest-api-requestresponse), then provide detailed stops on how to:

1. [register your client application with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](#register-your-client-application-with-azure-ad) to secure your REST requests
2. [create a REST request](#create-the-request)
3. [handle the REST response](#process-the-response).

> [!NOTE] For almost all Azure service REST APIs, there is a corresponding client SDK library which handles much of the client code for you. See:  
> 
> [Azure .NET SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api)  
> [Azure Java SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api)  
> [Azure CLI 2.0 SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure)  


## Components of a REST API request/response

A REST API request/response pair can be separated into 5 components:

1. The **URI**, which consists of the following: `{URI-scheme} :// {URI-host} / {resource-path} ? {query-string}`
    - URI scheme: indicates the protocol used to transmit the request. For example, `http` or `https`.  
    - URI host: the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, such as `graph.microsoft.com`  
    - Resource path: specifies the resource or resource collection, which may include multiple segments used by the service in determining the selection of those resources. For example: `beta/applications/00003f25-7e1f-4278-9488-efc7bac53c4a/owners` could be used to query the list of owners of a specific application within the applications collection.
    - Query string (optional): used to provide additional simple parameters, such as the API version, resource selection criteria, etc.
2. HTTP **request message header** fields
    - A required [HTTP method](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (also known as an operation or verb), which tell the service what type of operation you are requesting. Azure REST APIs support GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, and PATCH methods.
    - Optional additional header fields as required by the specified URI and HTTP method. For example, an Authorization header that provides a bearer token containing client authorization information for the request.
3. Optional HTTP **request message body** fields, to support the URI and HTTP operation. For example, POST operations contain MIME-encoded objects passed as complex parameters. The MIME encoding type for the body should be specified in the `Content-type` request header as well, for POST/PUT operations. Note that some services require you to use a specific MIME type, such as `application/json`.  
4. HTTP **response message header** fields
    - An [HTTP status code](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html), ranging from 2xx success codes to 4xx/5xx error codes. Alternatively, a service-defined status code may be returned, as indicated in the API documentation. 
    - Optional additional header fields as required to support the request's response, such as a `Content-type` response header.
5. Optional HTTP **response message body** fields
    - MIME-encoded response objects may be returned in the HTTP response body, such as a response from a GET method that is returning data. Typically these will be returned in a structured format as JSON or XML, as indicated by the `Content-type` response header. For example, when requesting an access token from Azure AD, it will be returned in the response body as the `access_token` element, one of several name/value paired objects in a data collection. In this example, a response header of `Content-Type: application/json` will also be included.

## Register your client application with Azure AD

Most Azure services (such as Azure Resource Manager providers) require your client code to authenticate with valid credentials before you can call the service's API. Authentication is coordinated between the parties by Azure AD, which provides your client with an [access token](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#access-token) as proof of the authentication/authorization. The token is then sent to the Azure service in the HTTP Authorization header of all subsequent REST API requests. The token's [claims](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#claim) also provide information to the service, allowing it to validate the client and perform any required authorization.

If you are using a REST API that does not use integrated Azure AD authentication, or you've already registered your client, you can skip to the [Create the request](#create-the-request) section. 

### Prerequisites

Before you can begin writing the REST API request code, you must first register your [client application](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#client-application) with an Azure AD [tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#tenant). If you do not have an Azure AD tenant yet, please see [How to get an Azure Active Directory tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/) before continuing. 

The steps below will create of 2 related objects in the Azure AD tenant where it is registered: an application object and a service principal object. For more background on the components that make up a registered application and how they are used at run-time, please review [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-application-objects/) before continuing.

### Client registration
1. Azure AD and the OAuth2 Authorization Framework support 2 types of clients. Before you register your application, decide which is the most appropriate for your scenario:  
    - [web/confidential](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#web-client) clients (run on a web server) can access resources under either their own identity (as a service/daemon), or obtain delegated authorization to access resources under the identity of the signed-in user.  
    - [native/public](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#native-client) clients (installed/run on a device) can only access resources under delegated authorization using the identity of the signed-in user. 
2. Next, register your client application with Azure AD. 
    - To register a client that will access an Azure Resource Manager REST API, see [Use portal to create Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/) for step-by-step registration instructions. This article will not only show you how to register the client application with Azure AD, it will also walk you through the steps required by Azure Resource Manager to properly configure its Role Based Access Control (RBAC) settings for authorizing the client. It also includes PowerShell and CLI versions of the article, if you prefer automated registration.
    - For all other clients, refer to [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-integrating-applications). In the "Adding an application" section you will create a baseline registration for the client. Then follow the steps under the "Updating an application" section, to:  
        - Gain an understanding of the Azure AD Consent Framework  
        - Create a secret key, if you are registering a web client. Because web clients are considered "confidential clients" by OAuth2, they must present their own credentials during Azure AD authentication to acquire an access token.  
        - Add any required [permission requests](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#permissions) as required by the API

## Create the request
If you are calling a REST API that does not require integrated Azure AD authentication, please jump to step #2 below. 

If your client application will be calling a secured REST API, the first step is to add code to acquire an access token. This will serve as proof of your client application's authenticity and enable it to make secured REST API requests:  

1. Obtain an access token from Azure AD

    Azure AD exposes service endpoints to facilitate application integration, and the 2 you will be interested in using are the /authorize and /token endpoints. How you use those endpoints will be dependent on your application's registration, and the type of [authorization grant flow](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dev-glossary/#authorization-grant) required in order to support your application at runtime. 

    For the purposes of this article, we will assume that your client will be using one of the following authorization grant flows. Follow the instructions for each to acquire the access token you will use in step #2:

    - **Authorization code grant**: can be used by both web and native clients, and requires credentials from a signed-in end-user in order to delegate resource access to the client application. This grant uses the /authorize endpoint to obtain an authorization code (in response to user sign-in/consent), and the /token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token.  
        - First https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code/#oauth-20-authorization-flow
        - Second
        - Third

    - **Client credentials grant**: can only be used by web clients, and allows the client application to access resources directly (no user delegation) using its own credentials (provided at registration time). This grant is typically used by headless (no UI) clients running as a daemon/service, and uses only Azure AD's /token endpoint to acquire an access token.
        - First https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service/ 

    Once your application successfully acquires the access token, it should look similar to the following:

    If you are debugging your application, here are a couple of useful tools for inspecting the token and its claims 

2. Add the Authorization request header

3. Now you are ready to call the REST API. As mentioned earlier, you will need to consider 3 of the 5 components required when making the request:

> [!NOTE] If you prefer to use client libraries to manage token acquisition instead of using the Azure AD REST endpoints. For more details, including reference documentation, library downloads, and sample code, please see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/).


## Process the response
In the example provided above, we used the /subscriptions endpoint to retrieve the list of subscriptions for our sample client application.
