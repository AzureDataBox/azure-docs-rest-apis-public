# Cognitive Services - Custom Search REST API

Bing Custom Search creates tailored search experiences. For example, if you own a bicycle website that provides a search experience, you can specify the domains, subsites, and webpages that Bing searches. Your users see search results that are tailored to the content they care about instead of having to page through general search results that may contain irrelevant content. For a more detailed overview, see the [Cognitive Services - Custom Search API overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/).
