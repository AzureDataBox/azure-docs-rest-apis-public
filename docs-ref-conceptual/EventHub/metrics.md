# Metrics
These APIs enable you to obtain metrics for an Event Hub. You can also access this data either through the Azure portal or by using the [Service Bus Entity Metrics REST APIs]().  
  
##  <a name="bk_common"></a> Common parameters and headers  
 The following information is common to all tasks that you might do related to Event Hubs metrics:  
  
-   Replace {api-version} with "2012-03-01" in the URL.  
  
-   Replace {servicebusNamespace} with the namespace obtained from the Azure classic portal.  
  
-   Replace {eventHubPath} with the path to your Event Hub.  
  
-   Replace {partitionId} with the ID of a partition on an Event Hub.  
  
-   Replace {consumerGroupId} with the ID of a consumer group in an Event Hub.  
  
-   Set the Content-Type header to **application/json**.  
  
-   Set the Authorization header to a SAS token (see the [Generate SAS token](generate-sas-token.md) section for more information), or a WRAPv0.9.7.2 token containing a SimpleWebToken acquired from ACS. Set to WRAP access_token=”{swt}”.
