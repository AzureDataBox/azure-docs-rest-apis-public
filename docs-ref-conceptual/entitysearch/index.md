# Cognitive Services - Entity Search REST API

The Entity Search API sends a search query to Bing and gets results that include entities and places. Place results include restaurants, hotel, or other local businesses. For places, the query can specify the name of the local business or it can ask for a list (for example, restaurants near me). Entity results include persons, places, or things. Places in this context include tourist attractions, states, countries, etc. For a more detailed overview, see the [Cognitive Services - Entity Search API overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-entity-search-api/).
