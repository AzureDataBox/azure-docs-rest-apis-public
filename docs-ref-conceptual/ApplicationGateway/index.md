# Application Gateway REST
Application Gateway is a Network Service which provides HTTP Load balancing as a Service to Azure customers. This is a fully managed service implemented as dedicated Hosted Service in a subscription owned by Gateway Manager but deployed in customer vnet. In addition to basic HTTP Load balancing, it provides other Layer 7 features like Cookie based client affinity and SSL offload, URL routing and multi-site hosting.
