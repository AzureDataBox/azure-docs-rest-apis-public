# Traffic Manager REST
Use these APIs to create and modify Traffic Manager profiles, their associated endpoints, and other settings.  
  
 Each profile is managed as an Azure Resource, of type [Traffic Manager profiles and endpoints](../TrafficManagerREST/traffic-manager-profiles-and-endpoints.md). See "Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources" for more details on resources groups and Azure resources. All operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification, you must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](../Topic/Authenticating%20Azure%20Resource%20Manager%20requests.md).
