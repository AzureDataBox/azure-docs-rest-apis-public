# Traffic Manager REST

Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control the distribution of user traffic for service endpoints in different datacenters. Service endpoints supported by Traffic Manager include Azure VMs, Web Apps, and cloud services. You can also use Traffic Manager with external, non-Azure endpoints.

Each profile contains a list of endpoints.  These endpoints are child resource of the profile, each with their own unique resource id.  Thus endpoints can be managed in two ways: both by modifying the endpoints list when updating a profile, or by modifying the endpoint resource directly.

| Operation Group | Description |

| [Geographic hierarchy](~/docs-ref-autogen/trafficmanager/GeographicHierarchies.json) | Gets the geographic hierarchy used by the georgraphic routing method.|
| [Traffic Manager profiles](~/docs-ref-autogen/trafficmanager/Profiles.json )    | Provides operations for Traffic Manager profiles.|
