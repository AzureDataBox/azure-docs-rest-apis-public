# Delete a Traffic Manager endpoint
Each profile contains a list of endpoints.  These endpoints are child resource of the profile, each with their own unique ARM resource id.  Thus an endpoint can be deleted in two ways: both by updating the endpoints list in the profile, or by deleting the endpoint resource directly.  
  
 This page explains the latter approachâ€”how to delete an individual Traffic Manager endpoint directly as a child resource within an existing profile.  
  
## Request  
 See [Traffic Manager profiles and endpoints](../TrafficManagerREST/traffic-manager-profiles-and-endpoints.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to Traffic Manager profiles and endpoints.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|DELETE|`https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/trafficManagerProfiles/{profile-name}/{endpoint-type}/{endpoint-name}?api-version={api-version}`|  
  
 Replace {profile-name} with the name of the Traffic Manager profile.  
  
 Replace {endpoint-type} with the type of the endpoint, one of:  
  
-   azureEndpoints  
  
-   externalEndpoints  
  
-   nestedEndpoints  
  
 Replace {endpoint-name} with the name of the endpoint.  
  
## Response
