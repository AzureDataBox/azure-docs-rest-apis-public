# Delete a Traffic Manager endpoint
Each profile contains a list of endpoints.  These endpoints are child resource of the profile, each with their own unique resource id.  Thus an endpoint can be deleted in two ways: both by updating the endpoints list in the profile, or by deleting the endpoint resource directly.  
  
This page explains the latter approachâ€”how to delete an individual Traffic Manager endpoint directly as a child resource within an existing profile.  

For information about getting started with Azure REST operations including request authentication, see [Azure REST API Reference](../../index.md).
