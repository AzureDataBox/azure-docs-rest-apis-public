# Create or update a connection
Create a connection between two provided gateway resources.  
  
## Request  
 See [Connections](connections.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to connections.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|`/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroup/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.network/connections/{connection-name}?api-version={api-version}`|  
|PATCH|`/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroup/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.network/connections/{connection-name}?api-version={api-version}`|  
  
 The Patch method can be used to update individual properties.  
  
```json  
{  
   "name": "cn1",  
   "location": "West US",  
   "tags": { "key1": "value1" },  
   "properties": {  
   "gateway1": {  
      "name": "firstgateway"  
   },  
   "gateway2": {  
      "name": "secondgateway"  
   },  
   "connectionType": "SiteToSite",  
   "connectivityState": "Connected",  
   "ipsecParameters": {  
      "encryptionType": "{encryptionType}",  
      "pfsGroup": {pfsGroup}",  
      "saDataSizeKilobytes": "{saDataSizeKilobytes}",  
      "saLifeTimeSeconds": "{saLifeTimeSeconds}",  
      "hashAlgorithm": "{hashAlgorithm}"  
   }  
}  
  
```  
  
|Element name|Required|Type|Description|  
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|name|Yes|String|The name of the request connection.|  
|location|*Yes*|String|The location value for the NRP instance that will receive this request. Connections are global objects, so this could be any location.|  
|gateway1|Yes|String|The name of the first gateway in this connection.|  
|gateway2|Yes|String|The name of the second gateway in this connection.|  
|connectionType|Yes|String|The type of this connection. This could be either `SiteToSite`, `PointToSite`, or `Dedicated`.|  
|connectivityState|Yes|String|The current state of this connection. Valid values are `Connected` or `Disconnected`.|  
|encryptionType|Yes|String|The type of encryption that will be used in a SiteToSite connection.|  
|pfsGroup|Yes|String|The pfs group that will be used in a SiteToSite connection.|  
|saDataSizeKilobytes|Yes|String|The number of kilobytes that can be sent across a SiteToSite connection before the connection’s IPsec SA will need to be renegotiated.|  
|saLifeTimeSeconds|Yes|String|The number of seconds that a SiteToSite connection’s IPsec SA will be valid before it needs to be renegotiated.|  
|hashAlgorithm|Yes|String|The hash algorithm that will be used when negotiating SiteToSite IPsec SAs.|  
  
## Response  
 Status code: 200 (OK) if the connection was successfully created or updated. 400 (Bad Request) if one of the gateways does not exist.
