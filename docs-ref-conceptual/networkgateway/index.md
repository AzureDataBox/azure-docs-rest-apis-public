# Azure Network Gateway REST API Reference
Use these APIs to create connections between Azure resources and on-premises resources. All operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification and each operation returns an x-ms-request-id header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](../../index.md).
