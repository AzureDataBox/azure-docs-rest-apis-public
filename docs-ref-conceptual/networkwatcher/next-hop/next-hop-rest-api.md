# Next hop REST API  

View the next hop from a VM. Using Next Hop, you can investigate where outbound traffic from your VM is heading first after it leaves the VM. Next hop allows you to view the type of Azure resource, the associated IP address of that resource, and the routing table rule that is responsible for the route.

This table lists the operations included in the Next hop REST API.  
  
| Operation | REST Verb | Description | 
|---------|---------|-----------|
