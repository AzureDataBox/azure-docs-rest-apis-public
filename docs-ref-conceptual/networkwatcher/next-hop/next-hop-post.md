# View IP flow

For a specified VM resource and a packet with specified direction using local and remote, IP addresses and ports, returns whether the packet is allowed or denied. If allowed or denied by a security group, provides the rule name. If no security group rule matches with input, it returns "Deny" and "RuleName" is not displayed. If you have not applied any security group on subnet or NIC, it reports "error".
