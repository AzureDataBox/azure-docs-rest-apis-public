# Get the health of an application by using an application health policy
Gets the health of a Service Fabric application, by using the specified health policy.  
  
## Request  
 See [Application](application2.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to applications.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|POST|This URI can be used to evaluate the health of an application:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Applications/{application-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|POST|This URI can be used to evaluate the health of an application with events, services and deployed applications filters:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Applications/{application-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}& EventsHealthStateFilter={ EventsHealthStateFilter}& DeployedApplicationsHealthStateFilter={ DeployedApplicationsHealthStateFilter}& ServicesHealthStateFilter={ServicesHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the application based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx). Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {DeployedApplicationsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on applications based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.
