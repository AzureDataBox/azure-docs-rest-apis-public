# Get the health of a service package
Gets the health of a Service Fabric service package.  
  
## Request  
 See [Service package](service-package.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to service packages.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI is used to get the health of the service package:<br />`<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetApplications/{application-name}/$/GetServicePackages/{service-package-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version=1.0`|  
|GET|The following URI is used to get the health of the service package with filters for events:  <br />`<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetApplications/{application-name}/$/GetServicePackages/{service-package-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version=1.0& EventsHealthStateFilter={ EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter for the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the service package based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx) . Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](status-and-error-codes1.md).
