# Service Fabric Names and JSON Request Bodies
When de-serializing Service Fabric Names in a JSON request body, the following should be considered:  
  
-   " " (space) should not be converted to `%20`  
  
-   `/` should be converted to `\/`  
  
 Therefore, .NET users should not convert their Service Fabric Name into a URI before deserializing it and should prefer string:  
  
 The following sample demonstrates the correct request body format for “/”  
  
```  
POST http://localhost:19007/Applications/$/Create?api-version=1.0 HTTP/1.1  
User-Agent: Fiddler  
Host: localhost:19007  
Content-Length: 114  
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8  
  
{"Name":"fabric:\/sample Application","TypeName":"PersistentPiEstimatorApp","TypeVersion":"1.0","ParameterList":[]}  
```
