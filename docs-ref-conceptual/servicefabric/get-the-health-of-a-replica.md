# Get the health of a replica
Gets the health of a Service Fabric service replica.  
  
## Request  
 See [Common parameters and headers](replica.md#bk_common) for parameters and headers that are used by all requests related to replicas.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Applications/{application-name}/$/GetServices/{service-name}/$/GetPartitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica with events filter:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Applications/{application-name}/$/GetServices/{service-name}/$/GetPartitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Services/{service-name}/$/GetPartitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica with events filter:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Services/{service-name}/$/GetPartitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Partitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a replica with events filter:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Partitions/{partition-id}/$/GetReplicas/{replica-id}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the replica based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx). Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](status-and-error-codes1.md).
