# Get the health of a cluster
Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster.  
  
## Request  
 See [Cluster](cluster.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to the cluster.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI gets the cluster health:<br />`<URI>$/GetClusterHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the cluster health with events filter:<br />`<URI>$/GetClusterHealth?api-version=2.0&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the cluster health with filters for nodes, applications and events: <br />`<URI>$/GetClusterHealth?api-version=2.0& NodesHealthStateFilter={NodesHealthStateFilter}&ApplicationsHealthStateFilter={ ApplicationsHealthStateFilter }& EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the cluster based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx). Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {NodesHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of NodeHealthState objects children of the cluster. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only nodes that match the filter will be returned. All nodes will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {ApplicationsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of ApplicationHealthState objects children of the cluster. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only application that match the filter will be returned. All applications will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](status-and-error-codes1.md).
