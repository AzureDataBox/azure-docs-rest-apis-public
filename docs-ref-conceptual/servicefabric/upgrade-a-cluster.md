|EnableDeltaHealthEvaluation|No|Boolean|1.0|When true, enables delta health evaluation rather than absolute health evaluation after completion of each upgrade domain.|

All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.<br />-   Rollback - Indicates that a rollback of the upgrade will be performed by Service Fabric if the upgrade fails. The value is 1.<br />-   Manual - Indicates that a manual repair will need to be performed by the administrator if the upgrade fails. Service Fabric will not proceed to the next upgrade domain automatically. The value is 2.|

### ClusterHealthPolicy  
  
```  
{  
        "ConsiderWarningAsError": false|true,  
        "MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes": <value>,  
        "MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications": <value>  
        "ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap":[{"Key":"<value>","Value":<value>}]}  
}  
  
```  
  
|Element name|Required|Type|Version|Description|  
|------------------|--------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|ConsiderWarningAsError|No|Boolean|1.0|Value of `true` to treat warnings as errors; `false` to not treat warnings as errors.|  
|MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes|No|Number|1.0|The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.|  
|MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications|No|Number|1.0|The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.|  
|ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap|No|Object|2.0|Specifies the map that defines the maximum percentage of unhealthy applications that are allowed per application type. Application types in this map are evaluated using specific percentages rather than the global *MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications* percentage.  For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures). All other applications can be evaluated with *MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications* set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances. The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for **HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation**.|  
  
### ClusterUpgradeHealthPolicy  
  
```  
{  
	 “MaxPercentDeltaUnhealthyNodes": <value>,  
 “MaxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes":<value>,

|Element name|Required|Type|Version|Description|  
|------------------|--------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|  
|MaxPercentDeltaUnhealthyNodes|No|Number|1.0|A value in the range [0, 100] that specifies the maximum allowed percentage of overall unhealthy nodes during upgrade when delta evaluation is enabled.|  
|MaxPercentUpgradeDomainDeltaUnhealthyNodes|No|Number|1.0|A value in the range [0, 100] that specifies the maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes per upgrade domain during upgrade when delta evaluation is enabled.|  
  
### ApplicationHealthPolicyMap  
  
```  
{  
    "ApplicationHealthPolicyMap":  
    [{  
        "Key":  “<value>”,  
        "Value": <value>  
    }]

```  
  
-   "Key” represents the Application name used to identify the application.
