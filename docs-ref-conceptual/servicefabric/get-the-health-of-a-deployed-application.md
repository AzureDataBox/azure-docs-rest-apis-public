# Get the health of a deployed application
Gets the health of an Azure Service Fabric application deployed on a node.  
  
## Request  
 See [Deployed application](deployed-application.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to applications.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI can be used to get the health of a deployed application on a node:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetApplications/{application-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI can be used to get the health of a deployed application on a node with events and deployed service packages filters:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetApplications/{application-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}& DeployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter={DeployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter for the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the deployed application based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx) . Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {DeployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter for [DeployedServicePackageHealth](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.deployedservicepackagehealth.aspx) children based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only deployed service packages that match the filter will be returned. All deployed service packages will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](status-and-error-codes1.md).
