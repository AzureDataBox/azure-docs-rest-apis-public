# Service Fabric REST APIs

[Service Fabric](http://aka.ms/ServiceFabric) is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. Service Fabric also addresses the significant challenges in developing and managing cloud applications. Developers and administrators can avoid complex infrastructure problems and focus on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads that are scalable, reliable, and manageable. Service Fabric represents the next-generation middleware platform for building and managing these enterprise-class, tier-1, cloud-scale applications.


A Service Fabric cluster is a network-connected set of virtual or physical machines into which your microservices are deployed and managed. [Service Fabric Resource Manager APIs](sfrp-index.md) allows you to create and manage Service Fabric cluster in Azure. Once a cluster is created you can manage and deploy microservices based applications and containers in the cluster using [Service Fabric Client APIs](sfclient-index.md). 


[Service Fabric Client APIs](sfclient-index.md) allows you to deploy and manage microservices based applications and containers in Service Fabric Cluster running in Azure, on-premise, local development machine or any other cloud.
