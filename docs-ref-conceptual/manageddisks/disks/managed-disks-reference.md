# Azure Managed Disks REST API Reference

The REST APIs for the Azure Managed Disks offer programmatic access to managed disks, virtual machine images, and snapshots.

For information about getting started with Azure REST operations including request authentication, see [Azure REST API Reference](../../../index.md).

## Managed disks  
 
Enables you to create disks for virtual machines without worrying about storage resources. To use the APIs, see [Disks](../disks/disks-rest-api.md).

## Virtual machine images  

Enables you to manage your own images. To use the APIs, see [Images](../images/images-rest-api.md).
  
## Snapshots  

Enables you to create copies of existing blobs, managed disks, or snapshots. To use the APIs, see [Snapshots](../snapshots/snapshots-rest-api.md)
