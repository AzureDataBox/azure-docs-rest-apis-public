# Node Users
  A node user is a user account created on a compute node for purposes of Remote Desktop login. The Batch service also creates user accounts for tasks to execute under, but these are not accessible through the REST API.  
  
 You can do the following with user accounts on nodes:  
  
-   [Add a user account to a node](../batchservice/add-a-user-account-to-a-node.md)  
  
-   [Delete a user account from a node](../batchservice/delete-a-user-account-from-a-node.md)  
  
-   [Update the properties of a user account on a node](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-user-account-on-a-node.md)
