|Element|Type|Notes|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|The id of the task.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the task|
|url|String|The URL of the task.|
|eTag|String|The ETag of the task. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the task has changed between requests. In particular, you can be pass the ETag with an Update Task request to specify that your changes should take effect only if nobody else has modified the job in the meantime.|
|lastModified|DateTime|The last modified time of the task.|
|creationTime|DateTime|The creation time of the task.|
|state|String|The current state of the task.<br /><br /> Possible values are:<br /><br /> **active** – The task is queued and able to run, but is not currently assigned to a compute node. A task enters this state when it is created, when it is enabled after being disabled, or when it is awaiting a retry after a failed run.<br /><br /> **preparing** – The task has been assigned to a compute node, but is waiting for a required Job Preparation task to complete on the node. If the Job Preparation task succeeds, the task will move to **running**. If the Job Preparation task fails, the task will return to **active** and will be eligible to be assigned to a different node.<br /><br /> **running** – The task is running on a compute node.  This includes task-level preparation such as downloading resource files or deploying application packages specified on the task – it does not necessarily mean that the task command line has started executing.<br /><br /> **completed** – The task is no longer eligible to run, usually because the task has finished successfully, or the task has finished unsuccessfully and has exhausted its retry limit.  A task is also marked as completed if an error occurred launching the task, or when the task has been terminated \(see [Terminate a task](../batchservice/terminate-a-task.md)\).|
|stateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the task entered its current state.|
|previousState|String|The previous state of the task. This property is not present if the task is in its initial active state.|
|previousStateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the task entered its previous state. This property is not present if the task is in its initial active state.|

|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#resourceFiles)|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.|
|[applicationPackageReferences](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#applicationPackageReferences)|Collection|A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Application packages are downloaded to a shared directory, not the task directory.  Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used.<br /><br /> If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails with a scheduling error.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#environmentSettings)|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the task.|
|[affinityInfo](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#affinityInfo)|Complex Type|A locality hint that can be used by the Batch service to select a node on which to start the new task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#constraints)|Complex Type|The execution constraints that apply to this task.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If absent, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|[executionInfo](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#executionInfo)|Complex Type|Contains information about the execution of the task.|
|nodeInfo|Complex Type|Contains information about the compute node on which the task ran.|
|[stats](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#stats)|Complex Type|Contains resource usage statistics for the task.|
|[multiInstanceSettings](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#multiInstanceSettings)|Complex Type|Specifies that the task  is Multi\-Instance Task requiring multiple compute nodes.  See [multiInstanceSettings](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#multiInstanceSettings) for details.|
|[dependsOn](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#dependsOn)|Complex Type|Specifies that the task depends on other tasks. The task will not be scheduled until all depended\-on tasks have completed successfully. \(If any depended\-on tasks fail and exhaust their retry counts, the task will never be scheduled.\)|
|[exitConditions](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md#exitConditions)|Complex Type|Specifies how the Batch service should respond to task exit codes and other ways in which the task could complete.|

###  <a name="resourceFiles"></a> resourceFiles

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|blobSource|String|The URL of a blob in Azure storage. The Batch service downloads the blob to the specified file path.<br /><br /> The URL must be readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present any credentials when downloading the blob.  There are two ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: use a Shared Access Signature \(SAS\) granting read permissions on the blob, set the ACL for the blob’s container to allow public access.|
|filePath|String|The location on the compute node to which the file should be downloaded.|
|fileMode|String|The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property is applicable only if the resourceFile is downloaded to a Linux node. This property will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which is downloaded to a Windows node.<br /><br /> If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.|

### <a name="applicationPackageReferences"></a> applicationPackageReferences

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|
|applicationId|String|The id of the application to install.|
|version|String|The version of the application to install.<br /><br />If omitted, the default version is installed. If no default version is specified for this application, the task on which the package is specified will fail when scheduled, with a scheduling error.|

###  <a name="environmentSettings"></a> environmentSettings

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|name|String|The name of the environment variable.|
|value|String|The value of the environment variable.|

###  <a name="affinityInfo"></a> affinityInfo

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|affinityId|String|An opaque string representing the location of compute node or a task that has run previously.  You can pass the affinityId of a compute node or task to indicate that this task needs to be placed close to the node or task.<br /><br /> You can obtain the affinityId for a node or a task via a GET request for that resource.|

###  <a name="constraints"></a> constraints

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|maxWallClockTime|Time Interval|The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it \(and any tasks that are still running\).  In this case, the termination reason will be *maxWallClockTimeExpiry*.<br /><br /> If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.|
|maxTaskRetryCount|Int32|The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit.<br /><br /> The default value is 0 \(no retries\).|

'Running' corresponds to the **running** state, so if the task specifies resource files or application packages, then the start time reflects the time at which the task started downloading or deploying these.  If the task has been restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at which the task started running.  This property is present only for tasks that are in the **running** or **completed** state.|
|endTime|DateTime|The time at which the task completed. This property is only returned if the task is in **completed** state.|

|lastRetryTime|DateTime|The most recent time at which a retry of the task started running.<br /><br /> This element is present only if the task was retried \(i.e. retryCount is nonzero\). If present, this is typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.|
|requeueCount|Int32|The number of times the task has been requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request.<br /><br /> When the user removes nodes from a pool \(by resizing or shrinking the pool\) or when the job is being disabled, the user can specify that running tasks on the nodes be requeued for execution. This count tracks how many times the task has been requeued for these reasons.|
|lastRequeueTime|DateTime|The most recent time at which the task has been requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request.<br /><br /> This property is present only if the requeueCount is nonzero.|

|------------------|--------------|----------|
|numberOfInstances|Int|The number of compute nodes required by the task.|
|coordinationCommandLine|String|The command line to run on all the compute nodes to enable them to coordinate when the primary runs the main task command. A typical coordination command line launches a background service and verifies that the service is ready to process inter\-node messages.|
|commonResourceFiles|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download before running the coordination command line.<br />The difference between common resource files and task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary, whereas task resource files are downloaded only for the primary.|

###  <a name="dependsOn"></a> dependsOn

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|taskIds|Collection|A list of task ids that this task depends on. All tasks in this list must complete successfully before the dependent task can be scheduled.|
