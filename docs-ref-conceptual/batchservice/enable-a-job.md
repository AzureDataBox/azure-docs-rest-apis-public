# Enable a job
  Enables the specified job, allowing new tasks to run.

## Request
 See [Common Parameters and Headers](../batchservice/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to jobs.

|Method|Request URI|
|------------|-----------------|
|POST|`https://{account-name}.{region-id}.batch.azure.com/jobs/{job-id}/enable?api-version={api-version}`|

 Replace {job\-id} with the id of the job that you want to update.

 The request body is empty.

## Response
 Status code: 202. For more information, see [Batch Status and Error Codes](../batchservice/batch-status-and-error-codes.md)

## Remarks
 On an Enable Job request, the Batch service sets a disabled job to the **enabling** state. After the Enable Job operation is completed, the job moves to the **active** state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job resumes.

 If you try to enable a job that is in any state other than **active**, **disabling**, or **disabled**, the request fails and Batch returns status code 409 \(Conflict\).

The Batch service does not allow a task to remain in the **active** state for more than
7 days. Therefore, if you enable a job containing active tasks which were added more
than 7 days ago, those tasks will not run.
