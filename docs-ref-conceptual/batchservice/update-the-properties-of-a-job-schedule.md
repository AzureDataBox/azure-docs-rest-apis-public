|Element|Type|Notes|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|[schedule](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#schedule)|Complex Type|The schedule according to which jobs will be created.|
|[jobSpecification](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#jobSpecification)|Complex Type|The configuration of the jobs to be created on this schedule.|

###  <a name="schedule"></a> schedule

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|doNotRunUntil|No|DateTime|Specifies the earliest time at which any job may be created under this job schedule.<br /><br /> If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.|
|doNotRunAfter|No|DateTime|Specifies a time after which no job will be created under this job schedule.  The schedule will move to the **completed** state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule.<br /><br /> If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.|
|startWindow|No|Time|Specifies the time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created.  If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the ‘opportunity’ is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule.<br /><br /> If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is ‘due’ in one recurrence interval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval.<br /><br /> The default is infinite.  The minimum value is 1 minute; if you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|
|recurrenceInterval|No|Time|Specifies the time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule.<br /><br /> A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time.  So if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes.  If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrence interval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval.<br /><br /> For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence.<br /><br /> The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes.<br /><br /> The minimum value is 1 minute; if you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|

###  <a name="jobSpecification"></a> jobSpecification

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|priority|Optional|Int32|The priority of jobs created under this schedule. Priority values can range from \-1000 to 1000, with \-1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority.<br /><br /> The default value is 0.|
|displayName|Optional|String|A display name for jobs created under this schedule. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#constraints)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the execution constraints for jobs created under this schedule.|
|[jobManagerTask](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#jobManagerTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies details of a Job Manager task to be launched when a job is started under this schedule.<br /><br /> If the job does not specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job using the Task API.<br /><br /> If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.|
|[jobPreparationTask](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#jobPreparationTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the Job Preparation task for jobs created under this schedule.<br /><br /> If a job has a Job Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.|
|[jobReleaseTask](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#jobReleaseTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the Job Release task for jobs created under this schedule.<br /><br /> A Job Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job.<br /><br /> The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.<br /><br /> The primary purpose of the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation.|
|commonEnvironmentSettings|Optional|Collection|A list of common environment variable settings.  These environment variables are set for all tasks in jobs created under this schedule \(including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release tasks\). Individual tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.|
|[poolInfo](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#poolInfo)|Required|Complex Type|Specifies the pool on which the Batch service runs the tasks of jobs created under this schedule.|
|usesTaskDependencies|Optional|Boolean|Specifies whether tasks in jobs created under this schedule can define dependencies on each other. The default is false.|
|onAllTasksComplete|No|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when all tasks in a job created under this schedule are in the completed state.<br /><br /> Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a job manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a job manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to **noaction** and update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to **terminatejob** once you have finished adding tasks.<br /><br /> Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing. The job remains active unless terminated or disabled by some other means.<br /><br /> **terminatejob** – terminate the job. The job’s terminateReason is set to "AllTasksComplete".<br /><br /> The default is **noaction**.|
|onTaskFailure|No|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when any task in a job created under this schedule fails. A task is considered to have failed if it completes with a nonzero exit code and has exhausted its retry count, or if it had a scheduling error. Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing.<br /><br /> **performexitoptionsjobaction** – take the action associated with the task exit condition in the task's exitConditions collection. (This may still result in no action being taken, if that is what the task specifies.)<br /><br />The default is **noaction**.|
|metadata|Optional|Collection|A list of name\-value pairs associated with each job created under this schedule as metadata.<br /><br /> The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.|

###  <a name="constraints"></a> constraints

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|maxWallClockTime|No|Time Interval|The maximum elapsed time that jobs created under this schedule may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it (and any tasks that are still running). In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry.<br /><br /> If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.|
|maxTaskRetryCount|No|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.|

###  <a name="jobManagerTask"></a> jobManagerTask

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|Yes|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.|
|displayName|No|String|A display name for the Job Manager task. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|commandLine|Yes|String|The command line of the Job Manager task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#resourceFiles)|No|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line. Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).|
|[outputFiles](#outputFile)|Collection|A list of files that the Batch service will upload from the compute node after running the command line. For multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task is executed.|
|[applicationPackageReferences](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#applicationPackageReferences)|No|Collection|A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used.<br /><br /> If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails to start due to an error.<br /><br /> This property is currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying the applicationPackageReferences property runs on a pool created with the Virtual Machine Configuration, the task fails with a scheduling error with error code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#environmentSettings)|No|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#constraints2)|No|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Manager task.|
|killJobOnCompletion|No|Boolean|Specifies whether completion of the Job Manager task signifies completion of the entire job.<br /><br /> If true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete.  If any tasks are still running at this time \(other than Job Release\), those tasks are terminated.<br /><br /> If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.<br /><br /> The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the job manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|No|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|runExclusive|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task requires exclusive use of the compute node where it runs.<br /><br /> If true, no other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running.<br /><br /> If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute node. \(The Job Manager task counts normally against the node’s concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent tasks.\)<br /><br /> The default value is true.|
|allowLowPriorityNode|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task may run on a low-priority compute node. The default value is false.|

###  <a name="jobPreparationTask"></a> jobPreparationTask

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|No|String|A string that uniquely identifies the job preparation task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobpreparation".<br /><br /> No other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with HTTP status code 409 \(Conflict\) and error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask.|
|commandLine|Yes|String|The command line of the Job Preparation task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#resourceFiles)|No|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file.<br /><br /> If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.<br /><br /> Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).<br /><br /> If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#environmentSettings)|No|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Preparation task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#constraints2)|No|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Preparation task.|
|waitForSuccess|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch Service should wait for the Job Preparation task to complete successfully \(that is, to exit with exit code 0\) before scheduling any other tasks of the job on the compute node.<br /><br /> The default is true.<br /><br /> If true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count \(as specified in the constraints element\).  If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to the compute node.  The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks of other jobs.<br /><br /> If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|No|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch service should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node reboots. The default value is true.<br /><br /> The Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the Job Preparation task did not complete \(e.g. because the reboot occurred while the task was running\). Therefore, you should always write a Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple times.|

###  <a name="jobReleaseTask"></a> jobReleaseTask

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|No|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobrelease".<br /><br /> No other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with HTTP status code 409 \(Conflict\) and error code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask.|
|commandLine|Yes|String|The command line of the Job Release task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#resourceFiles)|No|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file.<br /><br /> If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).<br /><br /> If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md#environmentSettings)|No|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Release task.|
|maxWallClockTime|No|TimeInterval|The maximum elapsed time that the Job Release task may run on a given compute node, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it.<br /><br /> The default value is 15 minutes.<br /><br /> You may not specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the Batch service rejects it with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|
|retentionTime|No|TimeInterval|Specifies the minimum time to retain the working directory for the Job Release task on the compute node.  After this time, the Batch service may delete the working directory and all its contents.<br /><br /> The default is infinite, i.e. the working directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|No|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|

###  <a name="resourceFiles"></a> resourceFiles

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|blobSource|Yes|String|The URL of a blob in Azure storage. The Batch service downloads the blob to the specified file path.<br /><br /> The URL must be readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present any credentials when downloading the blob.  There are two ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: use a Shared Access Signature \(SAS\) granting read permissions on the blob, set the ACL for the blob’s container to allow public access.|
|filePath|Yes|String|The location on the compute node to which the file should be downloaded.|
|fileMode|No|String|The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property is applicable only if the resourceFile is downloaded to a Linux node. This property will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which is downloaded to a Windows node.<br /><br /> If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.|

###  <a name="outputFile"></a> outputFile

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|filePattern|Yes|String|A pattern indicating which file(s) to upload.<br /><br /> Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the task working directory.<br /><br /> For wildcards, use * to match any character and ** to match any directory. For example, **\\*.txt matches any file ending in .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory.<br /><br /> Note that \\ and / are treated interchangeably and mapped to the correct directory separator on the compute node operating system.|
|[destination](#outputFileDestination)|Yes|Complex Type|The destination for the output file(s).|
|[uploadOptions](#outputFileUploadOptions)|Yes|Complex Type|Additional options for the upload operation, including under what conditions to perform the upload.|

###  <a name="outputFileDestination"></a> outputFileDestination

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|[container](#outputFileBlobContainerDestination)|Yes|ComplexType|A location in Azure blob storage to which files are uploaded.|

###  <a name="outputFileBlobContainerDestination"></a> outputFileBlobContainerDestination

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|path|No|String|The destination blob or virtual directory within the Azure Storage container. If filePattern refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no wildcards), then path is the name of the blob to which to upload that file. If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.|
|containerUrl|Yes|String|The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the file(s). The URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting write permissions to the container.|

###  <a name="outputFileUploadOptions"></a> outputFileUploadOptions

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|uploadCondition|Yes|String|The conditions under which the task output file or set of files should be uploaded. Possible values include:<br /><br /> - **taskSuccess**: Upload the file(s) only after the task process exits with an exit code of 0.<br /><br /> - **taskFailure**: Upload the file(s) only after the task process exits with a nonzero exit code.<br /><br /> **taskCompletion**: Upload the file(s) after the task process exits, no matter what the exit code was.<br /><br /> 
The default is taskCompletion.|### <a name="applicationPackageReferences"></a> applicationPackageReferences

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|applicationId|Required|String|The id of the application to install.|
|version|Optional|String|The version of the application to install.<br /><br />If omitted, the default version is installed. If no default version is specified for this application, the task on which the package is specified will fail when scheduled, with a scheduling error.|

## Response
 Status code: 200. For more information, see [Batch Status and Error Codes](../batchservice/batch-status-and-error-codes.md).

## Remarks
 The PUT request performs a full replace of all the updateable properties of the job. For example, if the *schedule* element is not specified, then the Batch service removes the schedule’s existing *schedule* and replaces it with the default schedule. The PATCH request replaces only the properties specified in the request.

 Updates to jobSpecification affect only jobs that are started after the request is received. Any currently active job continues with the older specification. If this includes a pool with a poolLifetimeOption of job, then the pool created for the current job will not be updated with the new values, but pools created for subsequent jobs will be.  \(If the pool has a poolLifetimeOption of jobSchedule, it will not be updated.\)

 Updates to the pool property in autoPoolSpecification complex type affect only the auto pool created for future jobs for the job schedule. The pool created for the current job will not be updated with the new values. To update the auto pool of the current job, the Pool APIs must be used.

 When a job is created, the current value of autoPoolSpecification stored in the job schedule will be applied to the job.  That means any updates on these properties on the job schedule will not apply to existing jobs and their auto pools.  You can still get the pool name via [Get information about a job in Batch](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-job-in-batch.md) and access the pool directly via normal Pool APIs.

 The job will store its own copy of the poolLifeTimeOption and keepAlive values.  These values are used to determine whether to delete the given autopool when the job completes.  If the pool lifetime scope is at the  job level and keepAlive is false, then the Batch service will delete the pool when the job completes.  You can call [Update the properties of a job](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job.md) to update the keepAlive flag for that job \(but you cannot update the poolLifeTimeOption\).  If the pool lifetime scope is at the jobschedule level, then the system will not delete the pool when the job completes.

 When the pool lifetime scope is at the jobschedule level, the Batch service keeps track of the last autopool created for the jobschedule, and deletes that pool when the jobschedule completes. Batch will also delete this pool if the user updates the autoPoolSpecification, which will cause a new pool to be created. There are two cases:

1.  Changing the pool lifetime scope from jobschedule level to job level.

2.  Changing the pool element in the autoPoolSpecification. It means that when the new job starts, the new pool specification will be used to create a new pool.
    Note that when the system deletes the existing pool, it will honor the existing keepAlive flag value prior to the update.

 Note that when the system deletes the existing pool, it will honor the existing keepAlive flag value prior to the update.
