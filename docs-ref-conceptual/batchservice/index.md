# Azure Batch REST API

Azure Batch enables you to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications efficiently in the cloud. It's a platform service that schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed collection of virtual machines, and can automatically scale compute resources to meet the needs of your jobs.

## REST operation groups

The Batch REST API provides operations for working with the following resources.

| Operation group               | Description                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Account](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/account.json)          | Provides operations for working with account-level resources. |
| [Application](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/application.json)  | Application packages provide management and deployment of the applications run by your tasks. |
| [Certificate](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/certificate.json)  | Operations for managing certificates on compute nodes. |
| [Compute Node](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/computenode.json) | Compute nodes are the virtual machines (VMs) in a pool that execute your jobs' tasks. |
| [File](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/file.json)                | Operations for working with the files on a compute node or associated with a task. |
| [Job](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/job.json)                  | A job manages a collection of tasks. |
| [Job Schedule](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/jobschedule.json) | Create and manage recurring jobs. |
| [Pool](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/pool.json)                | A pool is a collection of compute nodes, the virtual machines (VMs) that process your workloads. |
| [Task](~/docs-ref-autogen/batchservice/task.json)                | A task executes one or more applications on a compute node. |
