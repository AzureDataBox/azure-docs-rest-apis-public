# Azure Batch REST API Reference
  The REST APIs for the Azure Batch service offer developers a means to schedule large-scale parallel and HPC applications in the cloud.  
  
 Azure Batch REST APIs can be accessed from within a service running in Azure, or directly over the Internet from any application that can send an HTTPS request and HTTPS response.  
  
## Batch account  
 All access to the Batch service requires a Batch account, and the account is the basis for authentication.  
  
 The Base URL for Batch service is https://{account-name}.{region-id}.batch.azure.com  
  
## REST APIs  
 Use these APIs to schedule and run large scale computational workloads. All operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification and each operation returns a request-id header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure. For more information, see [Authenticate Requests to the Azure Batch Service](../batchservice/authenticate-requests-to-the-azure-batch-service.md).
