# Applications
  An application is a set of versioned binaries that can be automatically downloaded to compute nodes.  An application package refers to a specific set of binaries, representing a given version of the application (e.g. Litware 10.7).  An application can contain multiple packages, and also carries configuration options such as the default version of the application.  
  
 You can do the following with applications:  
  
-   [List the applications in the account](../batchservice/list-the-applications-in-the-account.md)  
  
-   [Get information about an application](../batchservice/get-information-about-an-application.md)
