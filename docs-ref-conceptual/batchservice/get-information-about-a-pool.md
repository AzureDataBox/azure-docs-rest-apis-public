# Get information about a pool
  Gets information about the specified pool.

## Request
 See [Common Parameters and Headers](../batchservice/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to pools.

|Method|Request URI|
|------------|-----------------|
|GET or HEAD|`https://{account-name}.{region-id}.batch.azure.com/pools/{pool-id}?$select={select-list}&expand=stats&api-version={api-version}`|

 Replace {pool\-id} with the id of the pool that you want to get information about.

 You can use the HEAD method to obtain just the HTTP status code and headers, excluding the pool details response body: this is useful for determining whether the pool exists or whether it has changed since you last obtained its details.

## Response
 Status code: 200. For more information, see [Batch Status and Error Codes](../batchservice/batch-status-and-error-codes.md)

 The following example shows information about a pool that does not include autoscaling, a start task, or certificates. See the examples later in this page of a pool with these optional elements.

|Element|Type|Notes|
|-------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|The id of the pool.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the pool|
|url|String|The url of the pool.|
|eTag|String|The ETag of the pool. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the pool has changed between requests.  In particular, you can be pass the ETag with an Update Job request to specify that your changes should take effect only if nobody else has modified the job in the meantime.|
|lastModifed|DateTime|The last modified time of the pool. This is the last time at which the pool level data, such as the targetDedicatedNodes or enableAutoscale, changed.  It does not factor in node\-level changes such as a compute node changing state.|
|creationTime|DateTime|The creation time of the pool.|
|state|String|The current state of the pool. Possible values are:<br /><br /> **active** – The pool is available to run tasks subject to the availability of compute nodes.<br /><br /> **deleting** – The user has requested that the pool be deleted, but the delete operation has not yet completed.<br /><br /> **upgrading** – The user has requested that the operating system of the pool’s nodes be upgraded, but the upgrade operation has not yet completed \(that is, some nodes in the pool have not yet been upgraded\). The pool may be able to run tasks \(with reduced capacity\) but this is not guaranteed.|
|stateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the pool entered its current state.|
|allocationState|String|Indicates whether the pool is resizing. Possible values are:<br /><br /> **steady** – The pool is not resizing. There are no changes to the number of nodes in the pool in progress. A pool enters this state when it is created and when no operations are being performed on the pool to change the number of dedicated nodes.<br /><br /> **resizing** \- The pool is resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the pool.<br /><br /> **stopping** \- The pool was resizing, but the user has requested that the resize be stopped, but the stop request has not yet been completed.|
|allocationStateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the pool entered its current allocation state.|
|vmSize|String|The size of the virtual machines in the pool. All virtual machines in a pool are the same size. <br/><br/> For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see [Sizes for Cloud Services](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/).
