# Add a job schedule to an account
  Adds a job schedule to the specified account.

## Request
 See [Common Parameters and Headers](../batchservice/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to job schedules.

|Method|Request URI|
|------------|-----------------|
|POST|`https://{account-name}.{region-id}.batch.azure.com/jobschedules?api-version={api-version}`|

 In the request body example below:

-   The schedule runs from 02:30 to 06:30 UTC on 10 September 2014.

-   It creates jobs every 5 minutes during that period.

-   It requires jobs to be created within 1 minute of that 5\-minute frequency.

-   Each job is constrained to run for no longer than 1 minute.

-   Each job runs myprogram.exe as a job manager task.

-   The jobs will run on a temporary "auto" pool.

-   The same auto pool will be used for all jobs run under the schedule.

-   All nodes of the auto pool will run myprogram2.exe as a start task.

-   The auto pool has a single metadata property named myproperty.

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|Yes|String|A string that uniquely identifies the schedule within the account. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters.  The id is case\-preserving and case\-insensitive \(that is, you may not have two ids within an account that differ only by case\).|
|displayName|No|String|A display name for the schedule. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|[schedule](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#schedule)|Yes|Complex Type|Specifies the schedule according to which jobs will be created.|
|[jobSpecification](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#jobSpecification)|Yes|Complex Type|Specifies details of the jobs to be created on this schedule.|
|[metadata](#bk_meta)|No|Collection|A list of name\-value pairs associated with the schedule as metadata.<br /><br /> The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.|

###  <a name="schedule"></a> schedule

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|doNotRunUntil|No|DateTime|Specifies the earliest time at which any job may be created under this job schedule.<br /><br /> If you do not specify a doNotRunUntil time, the schedule becomes ready to create jobs immediately.|
|doNotRunAfter|No|DateTime|Specifies a time after which no job will be created under this job schedule.  The schedule will move to the **completed** state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule.<br /><br /> If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.|
|startWindow|No|Time|Specifies the time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created.  If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the ‘opportunity’ is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule.<br /><br /> If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is ‘due’ in one recurrence interval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite.  The minimum value is 1 minute; if you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|
|recurrenceInterval|No|Time|Specifies the time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule.<br /><br /> A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time.  So if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes.  If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrence interval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval.<br /><br /> For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence.<br /><br /> The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes.<br /><br /> The minimum value is 1 minute; if you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|

###  <a name="jobSpecification"></a> jobSpecification

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|priority|Optional|Int32|The priority of jobs created under this schedule. Priority values can range from \-1000 to 1000, with \-1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority.<br /><br /> The default value is 0.|
|displayName|Optional|String|A display name for jobs created under this schedule. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#constraints)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the execution constraints for jobs created under this schedule.|
|[jobManagerTask](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#jobManagerTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies details of a Job Manager task to be launched when a job is started under this schedule.<br /><br /> If the job does not specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job using the Task API.<br /><br /> If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager task before scheduling other tasks in the job.|
|[jobPreparationTask](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#jobPreparationTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the Job Preparation task for jobs created under this schedule.<br /><br /> If a job has a Job Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that compute node.|
|[jobReleaseTask](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#jobReleaseTask)|Optional|Complex Type|Specifies the Job Release task for jobs created under this schedule.<br /><br /> A Job Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job.<br /><br /> The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute nodes that have run the Job Preparation task.<br /><br /> The primary purpose of the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation.|
|commonEnvironmentSettings|Optional|Collection|A list of common environment variable settings.  These environment variables are set for all tasks in jobs created under this schedule \(including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release tasks\). Individual tasks can override an environment setting specified here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.|
|[poolInfo](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#poolInfo)|Required|Complex|Specifies the pool on which the Batch service runs the tasks of jobs created under this schedule.|
|usesTaskDependencies|Optional|Boolean|Specifies whether tasks in jobs created under this schedule can define dependencies on each other. The default is false.|
|onAllTasksComplete|Optional|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state.<br /><br /> Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a job manager task; if you want to use automatic job termination without a job manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to **noaction** and update the job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to **terminatejob** once you have finished adding tasks.<br /><br /> Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing. The job remains active unless terminated or disabled by some other means.<br /><br /> **terminatejob** – terminate the job. The job’s terminateReason is set to "AllTasksComplete".<br /><br /> The default is **noaction**.|
|onTaskFailure|Optional|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if it completes with a nonzero exit code and has exhausted its retry count, or if it had a scheduling error. Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing.<br /><br /> **performexitoptionsjobaction** – take the action associated with the task exit condition in the task's exitConditions collection. (This may still result in no action being taken, if that is what the task specifies.)<br /><br />The default is **noaction**.|
|[metadata](#bk_meta)|Optional|Collection|A list of name\-value pairs associated with each job created under this schedule as metadata.<br /><br /> The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.|

###  <a name="constraints"></a> constraints

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|maxWallClockTime|No|Time Interval|The maximum elapsed time that jobs created under this schedule may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it (and any tasks that are still running). In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry.<br /><br /> If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run.|
|maxTaskRetryCount|No|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.|

###  <a name="userIdentity"></a> userIdentity

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|userName|No|String|The name of the user identity under which the task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both. |
|[autoUser](#autoUser)|No|Complex Type|The auto user under which the task is run. The userName and autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.|

###  <a name="autoUser"></a> autoUser

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|scope|No|Complex Type|The scope for the auto user.<br /><br />**pool** - specifies that the task runs as the common auto user account which is created on every node in a pool.<br /><br /> **task** - specifies that the service should create a new user for the task.<br /><br />The default value is **task**.|
|elevationLevel|No|Complex Type|The elevation level of the auto user.<br /><br />**nonAdmin** - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access.<br /><br />**admin** - The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator permissions.<br /><br />The default value is **nonAdmin**.|

###  <a name="jobManagerTask"></a> jobManagerTask
 A Job Manager task is special in the following ways:

-   The Batch service automatically creates it when the job is created.

-   The Batch service always tries to schedule the job manager task before other tasks in the job.

-   When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible.  That is, nodes running ‘normal’ tasks are removed before nodes running Job Manager tasks.

-   When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule this Job Manager task at the highest priority.  If there is no idle compute node available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart.

    -   A Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed.  For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job.

-   Users can specify if they want to terminate the job when the Job Manager task terminates \(either by completing successfully, or by running out of retries\).  In this case, if other tasks are running when the Job Manager terminates, those tasks are terminated too.

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|Yes|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.|
|displayName|No|String|A display name for the Job Manager task. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|commandLine|Yes|String|The command line of the Job Manager task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#resourceFiles)|No|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Files listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).|
|[outputFiles](#outputFile)|No|Collection|A list of files that the Batch service will upload from the compute node after running the command line. For multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task is executed.|
|[applicationPackageReferences](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#applicationPackageReferences)|No|Collection|A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Application packages are downloaded and deployed to a shared directory, not the task directory. Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used.<br /><br /> If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails to start due to an error.<br /><br /> This property is currently not supported on jobs running on pools created using the virtualMachineConfiguration (IaaS) property. If a task specifying the applicationPackageReferences property runs on a pool created with the Virtual Machine Configuration, the task fails with a scheduling error with error code TaskSchedulingConstraintFailed.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#environmentSettings)|No|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#constraints2)|No|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Manager task.|
|killJobOnCompletion|No|Boolean|Specifies whether completion of the Job Manager task signifies completion of the entire job. If true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete.  If any tasks are still running at this time \(other than Job Release\), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, the user needs to terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The default value is true.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|No|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|runExclusive|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task requires exclusive use of the compute node where it runs.<br /><br /> If true, no other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute node. \(The Job Manager task counts normally against the node’s concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent tasks.\)<br /><br /> The default value is true.|
|allowLowPriorityNode|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task may run on a low-priority compute node. The default value is false.|


###  <a name="jobPreparationTask"></a> jobPreparationTask
 A Job Preparation task is special in the following ways:

-   The Job Preparation runs on each compute node on which any other tasks of the job run, before those other tasks do so. This means you can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include:

    -   Downloading common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the compute node. \(AZ\_BATCH\_NODE\_ROOT\_DIR\\shared\).

    -   Starting a local service on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.

-   If a job has a Job Preparation task, the Batch service runs the Job Preparation task on a compute node before scheduling any task of that job on the compute node.

    -   Note, however, that if the Job Preparation task’s *waitForSuccess* setting is false, the Batch service may launch tasks of the job before preparation is complete, and will continue to schedule tasks on the node even if the Job Preparation task fails.

    -   If the Job Preparation task fails \(that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0\), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the compute node.  The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it is reimaged.  The node remains active and can be used for other jobs.

-   The Job Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation task to handle re\-execution. Batch runs a Job Preparation task on a compute node in the following cases:

    -   The Job Preparation task is run before the first time Batch schedules any other task of the job to run on the compute node.

    -   If the compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node before scheduling any other task of the job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not previously complete.

    -   If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation task is run again before scheduling any task of the job.

-   When a Job Preparation task starts, the Batch service downloads all the resource files of the Job Preparation task to the task’s working directory. The retention time for the Job Preparation task’s directory is measured from the end of the job. \(You can specify the retention time as part of the task constraints.\) After the retention time expires, the Batch service deletes this directory and all its contents.

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|No|String|A string that uniquely identifies the job preparation task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobpreparation".No other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with HTTP status code 409 \(Conflict\) and error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask.|
|commandLine|Yes|String|The command line of the Job Preparation task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#resourceFiles)|No|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line. If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file.<br /><br /> If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.<br /><br /> Files listed under this element are located in the task’s wd directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md). If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#environmentSettings)|No|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Preparation task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md#constraints2)|No|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Preparation task.|
|waitForSuccess|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch Service should wait for the Job Preparation task to complete successfully \(that is, to exit with exit code 0\) before scheduling any other tasks of the job on the compute node.<br /><br /> The default is true.<br /><br /> If true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count \(as specified in the constraints element\).  If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to the compute node.  The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks of other jobs.<br /><br /> If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|No|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If omitted, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess|No|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch service should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node reboots. The default value is true.<br /><br /> The Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the Job Preparation task did not complete \(e.g. because the reboot occurred while the task was running\). Therefore, you should always write a Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple times.|


###  <a name="jobReleaseTask"></a> jobReleaseTask
 
 A Job Release task is special in the following ways:

-   A Job Release task cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for the job.

-   The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the following:

    -   The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the job is still active.

    -   The job's maximum wall clock time constraint is reached, and the job is still active.

    -   The job's Job Manager task completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager completes.

-   The Job Release task runs on *each* compute node where tasks of the job have run.

    -   The Job Release task runs *only* on those nodes where the Job Preparation task ran and completed.

    -   If you reimage a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node \(and hence the Job Preparation task does not re\-run\), then the Job Release task does *not* run on that node.

-   If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node starts up.

-   The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks have completed.

    -   If a Job Release task fails \(exits with a nonzero exit code\), this does not prevent the job from completing.

    -   Job Release tasks are not retried if they fail.

-   The Job Release task runs in the background.  It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.

|Element name|Required|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|id|No|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobrelease".

If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur.</li> <li>The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute nodes to **unusable**. </li> <li>If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows.

## Response
 Status code: 201. For more information, see [Batch Status and Error Codes](../batchservice/batch-status-and-error-codes.md) .

## Remarks
 The priority in the job specification is used as the default priority for all jobs under the job schedule.  You can update a job’s priority after it has been created using [Update the properties of a job](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job.md).

 If you specify a pool id for jobs to run on, it is up to you to ensure the existence of the pool \(For more information, see [Add a pool to an account](../batchservice/add-a-pool-to-an-account.md).\)

 If you specify that jobs should run on an auto pool, and the system fails to create the pool when it comes to schedule a job, it places the job in the completed state and populates the job’s failureInfo property.  You can retrieve this error via [Get information about a job in Batch](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-job-in-batch.md). Also, the lifetime of the auto pool is managed by the Batch service: any user actions which affect the lifetime of the auto pool while the job schedule is active will result in unexpected behavior.
