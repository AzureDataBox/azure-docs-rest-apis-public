|-------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|The id of the job.|
|displayName|String|The display name of the job.|
|url|String|The URL of the job.|
|eTag|String|The ETag of the job. This is an opaque string. You can use it to detect whether the job has changed between requests.  In particular, you can be pass the ETag with an Update Job request to specify that your changes should take effect only if nobody else has modified the job in the meantime.|
|lastModified|DateTime|The last modified time of the job.  This is the last time at which the job level data, such as the job state or priority, changed.  It does not factor in task\-level changes such as adding new tasks or tasks changing state.|
|creationTime|DateTime|The creation time of the job.|
|state|String|The current state of the job.<br /><br /> Possible values are:<br /><br /> **active** – the job is available to have tasks scheduled<br /><br /> **disabling** –a user has requested that the job be disabled, but the disable operation is still in progress \(for example, waiting for tasks to terminate\)<br /><br /> **disabled** – a user has disabled the job. No tasks are running, and no new tasks will be scheduled. For more information, see Disable a job.<br /><br /> **enabling** – a user has requested that the job be enabled, but the enable operation is still in progress<br /><br /> **terminating** –the job is about to complete, either because a Job Manager task has completed or because the user has terminated the job, but the terminate operation is still in progress \(for example, because Job Release tasks are running\).<br /><br /> **completed** – all tasks have terminated, and the system will not accept any more tasks or any further changes to the job.<br /><br /> **deleting** –a user has requested that the job be deleted, but the delete operation is still in progress \(for example, because the system is still terminating running tasks\). For more information, see [Delete a job from an account](../batchservice/delete-a-job-from-an-account.md).|
|stateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the job entered its current state.|
|previousState|String|The previous state of the job. This property is not present if the job is in its initial active state.|
|previousStateTransitionTime|DateTime|The time at which the job entered its previous state.<br /><br /> This property is not present if the job is in its initial active state.|
|priority|Int32|The priority of the job. Priority values can range from \-1000 to 1000, with \-1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority.|

|onAllTasksComplete|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state.<br /><br /> Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing. The job remains active unless terminated or disabled by some other means.<br /><br /> **terminatejob** – terminate the job. The job’s terminateReason is set to "AllTasksComplete".<br /><br /> The default is **noaction**.|
|onTaskFailure|String|Specifies an action the Batch service should take when any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if it completes with a nonzero exit code and has exhausted its retry count, or if it had a scheduling error. Permitted values are:<br /><br /> **noaction** – do nothing.<br /><br /> **performexitoptionsjobaction** – take the action associated with the task exit condition in the task's exitConditions collection. (This may still result in no action being taken, if that is what the task specifies.)<br /><br />The default is **noaction**.|
|metadata|Collection|A list of name\-value pairs associated with the job as metadata.<br /><br /> The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.|

###  <a name="constraints1"></a> constraints

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|maxWallClockTime|Time Interval|The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it.<br /><br /> If this is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.|
|maxTaskRetryCount|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.|

###  <a name="jobManagerTask"></a> jobManagerTask

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Manager task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.|
|displayName|String|A display name for the Job Manager task. It need not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 1024.|
|commandLine|String|The command line of the Job Manager task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#resourceFiles)|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).|
|[outputFiles](#outputFile)|Collection|A list of files that the Batch service will upload from the compute node after running the command line. For multi-instance tasks, the files will only be uploaded from the compute node on which the primary task is executed.|
|[applicationPackageReferences](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#applicationPackageReferences)|Collection|A list of application packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> Application packages are downloaded to a shared directory, not the task directory.  Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the compute node is used.<br /><br /> If a referenced application package cannot be installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task fails to start due to an error.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#environmentSettings)|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Manager task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#constraints2)|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Manager task.|
|killJobOnCompletion|Boolean|Specifies whether completion of the Job Manager task signifies completion of the entire job.<br /><br /> If true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete.  If any tasks are still running at this time \(other than Job Release\), those tasks are terminated.<br /><br /> If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution.<br /><br /> The default value is true.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If absent, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|runExclusive|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task requires exclusive use of the compute node where it runs.<br /><br /> If true, no other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running.<br /><br /> If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute node. \(The Job Manager task counts normally against the node’s concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent tasks.\)The default value is true.|
|allowLowPriorityNode|Boolean|Specifies whether the Job Manager task may run on a low-priority compute node. The default value is false.|

###  <a name="jobPreparationTask"></a> jobPreparationTask

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|A string that uniquely identifies the job preparation task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobpreparation".<br /><br /> No other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Preparation task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with HTTP status code 409 \(Conflict\) and error code TaskIdSameAsJobPreparationTask.|
|commandLine|String|The command line of the Job Preparation task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#resourceFiles)|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file.<br /><br /> If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.<br /><br /> Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).<br /><br /> If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#environmentSettings)|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Preparation task.|
|[constraints](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#constraints2)|Complex Type|Specifies constraints that apply to the Job Preparation task.|
|waitForSuccess|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch Service should wait for the Job Preparation task to complete successfully \(that is, to exit with exit code 0\) before scheduling any other tasks of the job on the compute node.<br /><br /> The default is true.<br /><br /> If true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count \(as specified in the constraints element\).  If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to the compute node.  The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks of other jobs.<br /><br /> If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If absent, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch service should rerun the Job Preparation task after a compute node reboots. The default value is true.<br /><br /> The Job Preparation task is *always* rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the Job Preparation task did not complete \(e.g. because the reboot occurred while the task was running\). Therefore, you should always write a Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple times.|

###  <a name="jobReleaseTask"></a> jobReleaseTask

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|id|String|A string that uniquely identifies the Job Release task within the job. The id can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores and cannot contain more than 64 characters.<br /><br /> If you do not specify this property, the Batch service assigns a default value of "jobrelease".<br /><br /> No other task in the job can have the same id as the Job Release task. If you try to submit a task with the same id, the Batch service rejects the request with HTTP status code 409 \(Conflict\) and error code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask.|
|commandLine|String|The command line of the Job Release task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#resourceFiles)|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line.<br /><br /> If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file.<br /><br /> If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.<br /><br /> Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s **wd** directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md).<br /><br /> If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#environmentSettings)|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the Job Release task.|
|maxWallClockTime|TimeInterval|The maximum elapsed time that the Job Release task may run on a given compute node, measured from the time the task starts. If the task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it.<br /><br /> The default value is 15 minutes.<br /><br /> You may not specify a timeout longer than 15 minutes. If you do, the Batch service rejects it with HTTP status code 400 \(Bad Request\).|
|retentionTime|TimeInterval|Specifies the minimum time to retain the working directory for the Job Release task on the compute node.  After this time, the Batch service may delete the working directory and all its contents.<br /><br /> The default is infinite, i.e. the working directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If absent, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|

###  <a name="resourceFiles"></a> resourceFiles

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|blobSource|String|The URL of a blob in Azure storage. The Batch service downloads the blob to the specified file path.<br /><br /> The URL must be readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present any credentials when downloading the blob.  There are two ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: use a Shared Access Signature \(SAS\) granting read permissions on the blob, set the ACL for the blob’s container to allow public access.|
|filePath|String|The location on the compute node to which the file should be downloaded.|
|fileMode|String|The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property is applicable only if the resourceFile is downloaded to a Linux node. This property will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which is downloaded to a Windows node.<br /><br /> If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.|

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|filePattern|String|A pattern indicating which file(s) to upload.<br /><br /> Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the task working directory.<br /><br /> For wildcards, use * to match any character and ** to match any directory. For example, **\\*.txt matches any file ending in .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory.<br /><br /> Note that \\ and / are treated interchangeably and mapped to the correct directory separator on the compute node operating system.|

|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
|path|String|The destination blob or virtual directory within the Azure Storage container. If filePattern refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no wildcards), then path is the name of the blob to which to upload that file. If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.|
|containerUrl|String|The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the file(s). The URL must include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting write permissions to the container.|

###  <a name="outputFileUploadOptions"></a> outputFileUploadOptions

|maxTaskRetryCount|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> Note that this value specifically controls the number of *retries*. The Batch service will *try* the task once, and may then *retry* up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.|
|retentionTime|Time Interval|Specifies the minimum time to retain the working directory for the task on the compute node where it ran.  After this time, the Batch service may delete the working directory and all its contents.<br /><br /> The default is infinite, i.e. the working directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged.|

|poolId|String|Specifies the id of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the specified pool. To find the ids of existing pools, see [List the pools in the account](../batchservice/list-the-pools-in-the-account.md).<br /><br /> You must specify *either* poolId *or* autoPoolSpecification, but not both.|
|[autoPoolSpecification](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-in-an-account.md#autoPoolSpecification)|Complex Type|Specifies characteristics for a temporary ‘auto pool.’ The Batch service will create this auto pool and run all the tasks of the job will run on it, and will delete the pool once the job has completed.<br /><br /> You must specify *either* poolId *or* autoPoolSpecification, but not both.|

###  <a name="autoPoolSpecification"></a> autoPoolSpecification

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|autoPoolIdPrefix|String|The Batch service assigns each auto pool a unique identifier on creation. To distinguish between pools created for different purposes, you can specify this element to add a prefix to the id that is assigned. The prefix can be up to 20 characters long.|
|poolLifetimeOption|String|Specifies the minimum lifetime of created auto pools, and how multiple jobs on a schedule are assigned to pools.  Possible values are:<br /><br /> **job** – the pool exists for the lifetime of the job to which it is dedicated.  The Batch service creates the pool when it creates the job. If applied to a job schedule, the Batch service creates a new auto pool for every job created on the schedule.<br /><br /> **jobschedule** – the pool exists for the lifetime of the job schedule. The Batch Service creates the pool when it creates the first job on the schedule.  You may apply this option only to job schedules, not to jobs.|
|keepAlive|Boolean|Specifies whether to keep an auto pool alive after its lifetime expires.<br /><br /> If false, the Batch service deletes the pool once its lifetime \(as determined by the poolLifetimeOption setting\) expires; that is, when the job or job schedule completes.<br /><br /> If true, the Batch service does not delete the pool automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto pools created with this option.<br /><br /> The default value is false.|
