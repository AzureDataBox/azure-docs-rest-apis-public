# Get lifetime statistics for all pools
  Gets the lifetime statistics for all of the pools in the specified account. Statistics are aggregated across all pools that have ever existed in the account, from account creation to the last update time of the statistics.

##  <a name="bk_lifetime"></a> Request
 See [Common Parameters and Headers](../batchservice/common-parameters-and-headers.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to accounts.

|Method|Request URI|
|------------|-----------------|
