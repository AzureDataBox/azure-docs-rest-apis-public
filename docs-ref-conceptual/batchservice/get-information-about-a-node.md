###  <a name="recentTasks"></a> recentTasks

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|----------|-----------|
|taskUrl|String|The URL of the task.|
|jobId|String|The id of the job to which the task belongs.|
|taskId|String|The id of the task within the job.|
|subtaskId|Int32|If the task is a multi\-instance task, the id of the subtask within the task. This property is present only if the task is multi\-instance.|
|taskState|String|The current state of the task.|
|[executionInfo](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-node.md#executionInfo)|Complex Type|Information about the execution of the task.|

###  <a name="startTask"></a> startTask

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|
|commandLine|String|Specifies the command line of the start task.|
|[resourceFiles](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-node.md#resourceFiles)|Collection|A list of files that Batch will download to the compute node before running the command line. If you are providing the executable for the task, at least one instance of this element is required to specify the source location and target location of the executable file. If the task requires additional supporting files, add additional instances of this element to list these files.<br /><br /> Files that listed under this element are located in the task’s wd directory. For more information, see [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md). If the command line is a default server program, and requires no additional supporting files, you do not need to include this element.|
|[environmentSettings](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-node.md#environmentSettings)|Collection|A list of environment variable settings for the start task.|
|[userIdentity](#userIdentity)|Complex Type|The user identity under which the task runs. If absent, the task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the task.|
|maxTaskRetryCount|Int32|The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.<br /><br /> Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times \(one initial try and 3 retries\).<br /><br /> If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is \-1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.|
|waitForSuccess|Boolean|Specifies whether the Batch Service should wait for the start task to complete successfully \(that is, to exit with exit code 0\) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node.<br /><br /> If **true** and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count \(maxTaskRetryCount\). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it.  This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail.<br /><br /> If **false**, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.<br /><br /> The default is **true**.|

###  <a name="resourceFiles"></a> resourceFiles

|Element name|Type|Notes|
|------------------|--------------|----------|
|blobSource|String|The URL of a blob in Azure storage. The Batch service downloads the blob to the specified file path.<br /><br /> The URL must be readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present any credentials when downloading the blob.  There are two ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage:<br /><br /> 1.  Use a Shared Access Signature \(SAS\) granting read permissions on the blob.<br />2.  Set the ACL for the blob’s container to allow public access.|
|filePath|String|The location on the compute node to which the file should be downloaded.|
|fileMode|String|The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property is applicable only if the resourceFile is downloaded to a Linux node. This property will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which is downloaded to a Windows node.<br /><br /> If this property is not specified for a Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.|

Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are retried, while pre-processing errors (e.g., the task could not be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up to the limit specified by the constraints. The task is retried if it exits with a nonzero exit code, up to the specified MaxTaskRetryCount.|
|lastRetryTime|DateTime|The most recent time at which a retry of the task started running. This element is present only if the task was retried \(i.e. retryCount is nonzero\). If present, this is typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.|
