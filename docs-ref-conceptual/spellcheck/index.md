Bing Spell Search API v7 provides correction for web searches (‘Spell’) and documents (‘Proof’). ‘Spell’ is more aggressive in order to return better search results, while ‘Proof’ is less aggressive and adds capitalization, basic punctuation, and other features to aid document creation. With the API v7, discover new improved error handling to make it easy to troubleshoot and diagnose any problem queries.
