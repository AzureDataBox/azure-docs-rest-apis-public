# Cognitive Services - Content Moderator REST API

Cognitive Services - Content moderation is the process of monitoring user-generated content on online and social media websites, chat and messaging platforms, enterprise environments, gaming platforms, and peer communication platforms. The goal is to track, flag, assess, and filter out offensive and unwanted content that creates risk for your organization. Moderated content might include text, images, and videos. For a more detailed overview, see the [Cognitive Services - Content Moderator API product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/content-moderator/).
