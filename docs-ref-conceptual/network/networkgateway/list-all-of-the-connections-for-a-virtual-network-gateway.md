|Element name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|name|The name of the request connection.|  
|location|The location value for the NRP instance that will receive this request. Connections are global objects, so this could be any location.|  
|gateway1|The name of the first gateway in this connection.|  
|gateway2|The name of the second gateway in this connection.|  
|connectionType|The type of this connection. This could be either `SiteToSite`, `PointToSite`, or `Dedicated`.|  
|connectivityState|The current state of this connection. Valid values are `Connected` or `Disconnected`.|  
|allocatedIPAddress|An IP address that has been allocated to a client in a PointToSite connection.|  
|encryptionType|The type of encryption that will be used in a SiteToSite connection.|  
|pfsGroup|The pfs group that will be used in a SiteToSite connection.|  
|saDataSizeKilobytes|The number of kilobytes that can be sent across a SiteToSite connection before the connection’s IPsec SA will need to be renegotiated.|  
|saLifeTimeSeconds|The number of seconds that a SiteToSite connection’s IPsec SA will be valid before it needs to be renegotiated.|  
|hashAlgorithm|The hash algorithm that will be used when negotiating SiteToSite IPsec SAs.|
