# Subnets

Subnets represent network segments within the IP space defined by the virtual network.  
  
Subnets are child resources of a virtual network. Subnets have names unique within a VNET and they can be addressed via URIs. Subnets can be added and deleted by updating VNET or via PUT/DELETE against individual subnets.
