# List virtual network peerings within a virtual network
This operation lists all virtual network peerings in a virtual network

For information about getting started with Azure REST operations including request authentication, see [Azure REST API Reference](../../../index.md).

## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|`/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{virtualNetworkName}/virtualNetworkPeerings?api-version={api-version}`|  

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| subscriptionId | The identifier of your subscription where the virtual network peering exists. |
| resourceGroup | The name of the resource group that contains the virtual network peering. |
| virtualNetworkName | The name of the virtual network. |
| api-version | The version of the API to use. The current version is 2016-09-01. |

|Element name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|name|The name of the Virtual Network Peering.|  
|id|The identifying URL of the Virtual Network Peering.|  
|etag|System generated meta-data enabling concurrency control|  
|provisioningState|Provisioning state of the Virtual Network Peering|  
|virtualNetworkPeerings.peeringState|State of the Virtual Network peering. Possible values are: **Initiated**, **Connected**, or **Disconnected** |
|remoteVirtualNetwork.id|The identifying URI of the peer Virtual Network|
|allowVnetAccess| Indicates if communication between the two virtual networks is possible by automatic opening of ACLs. Possible values are: <br /><br />**True:** (default) The peer Virtual Network's address is included as part of the VIRTUAL_NETWORK tag <br /><br /> **False:** The peer Virtual Network's address is not included as part of VIRTUAL_NETWORK tag. The VMs in the peer Virtual Network space would not be able to access the VMs in local Virtual Network space> You would have to set explicit NSG rules to allow communication between the Virtual Networks.|
|allowForwardedTraffic| Possible values are: <br /><br />**True:** Forwarded traffic (traffic not originating from the VMs in the peer Virtual Nework) will be allowed. <br /><br /> **False:** Forwarded traffic (traffic not originating from the VMs in the peer Virtual Nework) will not be allowed. |
|allowGatewayTransit| Indicates if peer Virtual Networks can access the Virtual Network's Gateway. It does not indicate if the Gateway is already being used. Possible values are: <br /><br />**True:** The peer Virtual Nework can use the Virtual network Gateway of this Virtual network for connecting to on-premises networks. <br /><br /> **False:** The peer Virtual Nework can not use the Virtual network Gateway of this Virtual network for connecting to on-premises networks.|
|useRemoteGateways| Possible values are: <br /><br />**True:** If the flag is set to true, and allowGatewayTransit on peer Virtual Network is also true, the Virtual Network  will use the Gateway of the peer Virtual Network for transit. Only 1 peering can have this flag set to true. <br /><br /> **False:** If this flag is set to false, the Virtual Network is not able to use the remote Gateway for transit.|
