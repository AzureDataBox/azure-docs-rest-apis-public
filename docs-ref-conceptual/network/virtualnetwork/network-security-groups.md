# Network Security Groups
A network security group (NSG) resource contains a list of network security rules. NSGs enable inbound or outbound traffic to be enabled or denied.  
  
NSGs are created with a set of default network security rules which are designed to enable all communications from and within a virtual network, but deny external access to same.  
  
NSGs can be assigned to subnets or individual NICs. Where NSGs are assigned to both a subnet and a NIC, the combination of both NSGs applies to that NIC.
