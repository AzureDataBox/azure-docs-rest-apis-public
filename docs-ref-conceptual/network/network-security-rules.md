# Network Security Rules
Network security rules define a pattern of traffic to be enabled or denied. Network security rules are contained within a Network Security Group (NSG). NSGs can be applied at the subnet or NIC level.  
  
Default network security rules are created to protect your virtual network by default. It is not possible to edit or delete a default network security rule, but they can be overridden by creating a network security rule with a lower priority. Default network security rules have priorities of 65000 and greater. To override a default network security rule, create a network security rule with a priority of less than 65000.
