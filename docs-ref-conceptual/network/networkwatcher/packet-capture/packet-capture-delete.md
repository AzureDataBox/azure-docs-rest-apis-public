# Delete a packet capture

Delete removes a packet capture session. To ensure that a capture is saved to storage or the local file system the recommended course of action when deleting packet captures is:

1. Stop the packet capture session.

2. Query the packet capture status until the session has successfully stopped (PacketCaptureStatus: Stopped)

3. Delete the Packet Capture session.

If Delete is called on a running packet capture session, there is no guarantee that data from the session will be retained.

For information about getting started with Azure REST operations including request authentication, see [Azure REST API Reference](../../../../index.md).
