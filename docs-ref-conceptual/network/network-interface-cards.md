# Network Interface Cards
Network interface cards are virtual network cards that form the link between virtual machines and the virtual network. Each VM has at least 1 network interface card. Multiple subnets can be bound to the same network interface card and can have 1 or more IP addresses bound to it. Network interface cards must be associated with a public IP address to be accessible over the Internet.
