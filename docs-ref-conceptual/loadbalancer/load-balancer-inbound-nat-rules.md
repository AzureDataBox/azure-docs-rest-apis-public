# Operations on Load balancer inbound NAT rules

Inbound NAT Rules control how inbound traffic coming to frontend IP (VIP) of the load balancer is forwarded to private IP (DIP) of a VM behind the load balancer. These rules are often used for setting up RDP connection to a VM. Each rule has a reference to a frontend IP configuration of the load balancer and a reference to a private IP on a network interface of the VM. Reference to the private IP is read-only, it gets updated using Update Network Interface Card operation.
