# Load Balancers REST
## Load balancer  
 Load balancer allows fine-grained configuration of how incoming traffic is distributed across VM instances hosted in Microsoft Azure. A load balancer has two main parts: a frontend and a backend configuration. The frontend configuration describes the exposed IP address of the load balancer. The frontend IP address of a load balancer can be a public or private IP address. The backend configuration of a load balancer describes how the traffic is distributed across VM instances and how health of a particular VM instance is determined.  
  
 You can do the following with [Load balancer](load-balancer.md):  
  
-   [Create or update a load balancer](create-or-update-a-load-balancer.md)  
  
-   [Delete a load balancer](delete-a-load-balancer.md)  
  
-   [Get information about a load balancer ](get-information-about-a-load-balancer.md)  
  
-   [List load balancers within a resource group](list-load-balancers-within-a-resource-group.md)  
  
-   [List load balancers within a subscription](list-load-balancers-within-a-subscription.md)  
  
## Load balancer inbound NAT rules  
 Inbound NAT Rules control how inbound traffic coming to frontend IP (VIP) of the load balancer is forwarded to private IP (DIP) of a VM behind the load balancer. These rules are often used for setting up RDP connection to a VM. Each rule has a reference to a frontend IP configuration of the load balancer and a reference to a private IP on a network interface of the VM. Reference to the private IP is read-only, it gets updated using Update Network Interface Card operation.  
  
 You can do the following with [Load balancer inbound NAT rules](load-balancer-inbound-nat-rules.md):

-   [List inbound NAT rules of a load balancer](list-inbound-nat-rules-of-a-load-balancer.md)
