# Azure Data Lake Analytics REST API

Use the Azure Data Lake Analytics REST APIs to create and manage Data Lake Analytics resources through Azure Resource Manager. All task operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification and most operations return an `x-ms-request-id` header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure, using `https`. For more information on making secure requests, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx).
