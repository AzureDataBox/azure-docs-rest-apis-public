# Stop a virtual machine    
    
## Request    

For information about getting started with Azure REST operations including request authentication, see [Azure REST API Reference](../../../index.md). 

| Method | Request URI |

| POST | `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm}/powerOff?api-version={apiVersion}` |

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| subscriptionId | The identifier of your subscription. |
| resourceGroup | The resource group that contains the virtual machine. |
| vm | The name of the virtual machine to stop. |

## Response    
 
Status code: If successful, the operation returns HTTP status code of 200 (OK).    
    
## Remarks    
 
This operation only stops the virtual machine. The virtual machine can be restarted with the same provisioned resources. You are still charged for this virtual machine. If you want to stop a machine and not be charged for it, use [Stop and deallocate a VM](virtualmachines-stop-deallocate.md).
