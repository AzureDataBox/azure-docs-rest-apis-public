## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>

A discriminator property. Its value must be 'ImageStorePath' for objects of type 'ProvisionApplicationTypeDescription'.

____
### Async
__Type__: boolean <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
Indicates whether or not provisioning should occur asynchronously. When set to true, the provision operation returns when the request is accepted by the system, and the provision operation continues without any timeout limit. The default value is false. For large application packages, we recommend setting the value to true.
