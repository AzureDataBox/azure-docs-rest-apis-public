# Azure Time Series Insights API

Azure Time Series Insights is a fully managed cloud service with storage, analytics, and visualization components that make it incredibly easy to ingest, store, explore, and analyze billions of events simultaneously.

Azure Time Series Insights operate on containers that are called environments.
Time Series Insights environment is an Azure resource with ingress and storage capacity.
