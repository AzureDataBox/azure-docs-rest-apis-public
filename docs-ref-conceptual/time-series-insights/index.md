# Azure Time Series Insights API

Azure Time Series Insights is a fully managed cloud service with storage, analytics, and visualization components that make it incredibly easy to ingest, store, explore, and analyze billions of events simultaneously.

Azure Time Series Insights operate on containers that are called environments.
Time Series Insights environment is an Azure resource with ingress and storage capacity.

Customers provision and manage environments via the Azure portal and Azure Management APIs. To get started and create an environment, see [Create an environment](/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-get-started).

To query and view the data in the environments, customers use [Time Series Insights Portal](http://insights.timeseries.azure.com) or create custom applications using [Query API](time-series-insights-reference-QueryAPI.md).

Query operations are described in [Query API](time-series-insights-reference-QueryAPI.md).
Supported query constructs and input format are described in [Query Syntax](time-series-insights-reference-Query-Syntax.md).
