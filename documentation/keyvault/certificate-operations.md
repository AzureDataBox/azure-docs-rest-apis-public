# Certificate operations

The Key Vault Certificate Management provides for management of your x509 Certificates and supports the following important behaviors.

- Allows a KV certificate owner to implement secure storage and management of X509 certificates without an application operator's interaction with private key material.


- Allows a certificate owner to create a policy that directs Key Vault to manage the life-cycle of a certificate.


- Allows certificate owners to set contacts for notification of life-cycle events such as expiration or renewal.


- Allows for automatic enrollment and renewal with a few selected issuers (partner X509 certificate providers/authorities)


For more information on Key Vault certificates, see [About keys, secrets, and certificates](about-keys--secrets-and-certificates.md).

## How to guidance
[Get started with certificates](certificate-scenarios.md) leads you through creating your first Key Vault certificate as well as other types of tasks.
