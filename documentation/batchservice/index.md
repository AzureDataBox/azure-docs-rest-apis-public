# Azure Batch

Azure Batch enables you to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) applications efficiently in the cloud. It's a platform service that schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed collection of virtual machines, and can automatically scale compute resources to meet the needs of your jobs.

## REST operation groups

The Batch REST API provides operations for working with the following resources.

| Operation group     | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| [Account](./account) | test            |
