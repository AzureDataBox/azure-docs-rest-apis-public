# IoT Hub Resource Provider REST
Use these APIs to manage IoT hubs through the IoT Hub Resource Provider. All task operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification and each operation returns an x-ms-request-id header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/Dn790557.aspx).

## IoT hubs  
 Manage IoT hubs in your subscription.  
  
###  <a name="bk_common"></a> Common parameters and headers  
 The following information is common to all tasks related to IoT Hub:  
  
-   Replace {api-version} with “2016-02-03” in the URI.  
  
-   Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription identifier in the URI.  
  
-   Replace {resourceGroupName} with the resource group name that contains (or will contain) your IoT hub.  
  
-   Replace {IoTHubName} with the name of your IoT hub.  
  
-   Set the Content-Type header to application/json.  
  
-   Set the Authorization header to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/Dn790557.aspx).  
  
-   All PUT/PATCH operations require the following headers to be specified: `If-Match = [*|<etag from get>]`  
  
-   DELETE operations may include the following header: `If-Match = [*|<etag from get>]`  
  
 The behavior for ETags can be seen below:  
  
||||  
|-|-|-|  
|PUT|Resource does not exist|Resource exists|  
|If-Match = "" / absent|201 Created|200 OK|  
|If-Match = "*"|412 Precondition Failed|200 OK|  
|If-Match = "xyz"|412 Precondition Failed|200 OK / 412 Precondition Failed|  
|If-None-Match = "*"|201 Created|412 Precondition Failed|  
  
||||  
|-|-|-|  
|DELETE|Resource does not exist|Resource exists|  
|If-Match = "" / absent|204 No Content|200 OK|  
|If-Match = "*"|204 No Content|200 OK|  
|If-Match = "xyz"|204 No Content|200 OK / 412 Precondition Failed|  
  
 For asynchronous calls:  
  
-   PUT will respond with 201 Created with Azure-AsyncOperation header for any operations that are asynchronous.  All synchronous (updates) operations will return 200 OK.  
  
-   DELETE will return 202 Accepted with Location and Retry-After headers as well as Azure-AsyncOperation header for resources that exists.  
  
-   Location header contains URL for the operation result  
  
-   Retry-After header contains appropriate retry interval in seconds  
  
-   Azure-AsyncOperation header contains URL for the Async operation result status  
  
-   On completion, the GET to the operation result URL will generate exactly the same result as if the original operation had completed synchronously
