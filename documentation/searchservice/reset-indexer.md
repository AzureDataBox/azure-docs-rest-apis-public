# Reset Indexer (Azure Search Service REST API)
  The **Reset Indexer** operation resets the change tracking state associated with the indexer. This allows you to trigger from-scratch re-indexing (for example, if your data source schema has changed), or to change the data change detection policy for a data source associated with the indexer. See [Create Indexer &#40;Azure Search Service REST API&#41;](create-indexer.md) for information about change tracking state.  
  
```  
    POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]/reset?api-version=[api-version]  
    api-key: [admin key]  
```  
  
 The **api-version** is required. The current version is `2015-02-28`. [Azure Search Service Versioning](../Topic/Azure%20Search%20Service%20Versioning.md) has details, including more information about alternative versions.  
  
 The **api-key** must be an admin key (as opposed to a query key). Refer to the authentication section in [Azure Search Service REST](service-rest.md) to learn more about keys. [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) explains how to get the service URL and key properties used in the request.
