# OData Expression Syntax for Azure Search
  Azure Search supports a subset of the OData expression syntax for **$filter** expressions.  
  
## Operators  
  
-   Logical operators (and, or, not).  
  
-   Comparison expressions (`eq, ne, gt, lt, ge, le`). String comparisons are case-sensitive.  
  
-   Constants of the supported EDM types (see [Supported data types &#40;Azure Search&#41;](../SearchServiceREST/supported-data-types.md) for a list of supported types). Constants of collection types are not supported.  
  
-   References to field names. Only `filterable` fields can be used in filter expressions.  
  
-   `any` with no parameters. This tests whether a field of type `Collection(Edm.String)` contains any elements.  
  
-   `any` and `all` with limited lambda expression support. `any/all` are supported on fields of type `Collection(Edm.String)`. `any` can only be used with simple equality expressions, and `all` can only be used with simple inequality expressions. Simple expressions consist of a comparison between a single field and a literal value, e.g. `Title eq 'Magna Carta'`.  
  
-   Geospatial functions `geo.distance` and `geo.intersects`. The `geo.distance` function returns the distance in kilometers between two points, one being a field and one being a constant passed as part of the filter. The `geo.intersects` function returns true if a given point is within a given polygon, where the point is a field and the polygon is specified as a constant passed as part of the filter.  
  
    The polygon is a two-dimensional surface stored as a sequence of points defining a bounding ring (see the example below). The polygon needs to be closed, meaning the first and last point sets must be the same. [Points in a polygon must be in counterclockwise order](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798938.aspx#Anchor_1).
  
    Note that `geo.distance` returns distance in kilometers in Azure Search. This differs from other services that support OData geospatial operations, which typically return distances in meters.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For the result of the `geo.distance` function only the `lt, le, gt, ge` operators are supported. Operators `eq` and `ne` cannot be used.  
  
## Geospatial queries and polygons spanning the 180th meridian  
 For many geospatial query libraries formulating a query that includes the 180th meridian (near the dateline) is either off-limits or requires a workaround, such as splitting the polygon into two, one on either side of the meridian.  
  
 In Azure Search, geospatial queries that include 180-degree longitude will work as expected if the query shape is rectangular and your coordinates align to a grid layout along longitude and latitude (for example, `geo.intersects(location, geography'POLYGON((179 65,179 66,-179 66,-179 65,179 65))'`). Otherwise, for non-rectangular or unaligned shapes, consider the split polygon approach.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_unsupported"></a> Unsupported features of OData filters  
  
-   Arithmetic expressions  
  
-   Functions (except the distance and intersects geospatial functions)  
  
-   `any/all` with arbitrary lambda expressions  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_limits"></a> Filter size limitations  
 There are limits to the size and complexity of filter expressions that you can send to Azure Search. The limits are based roughly on the number of clauses in your filter expression. A good rule of thumb is that if you have hundreds of clauses, you are at risk of running into the limit. We recommend designing your application in such a way that it does not generate filters of unbounded size.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_examples"></a> OData filter examples  
 For more details on OData filters and URI conventions, see [OData.org](http://odata.org).  
  
 Find all hotels with a base rate less than $100 that are rated at or above 4:  
  
```  
$filter=baseRate lt 100.0 and rating ge 4  
```  
  
 Find all hotels other than "Roach Motel" that have been renovated since 2010:  
  
```  
$filter=hotelName ne 'Roach Motel' and lastRenovationDate ge 2010-01-01T00:00:00Z  
```  
  
 Find all hotels with a base rate less than $200 that have been renovated since 2012, with a datetime literal that includes time zone information for Pacific Standard Time:  
  
```  
$filter=baseRate lt 200 and lastRenovationDate ge 2012-01-01T00:00:00-08:00  
```  
  
 Find all hotels that have parking included and do not allow smoking:  
  
```  
$filter=parkingIncluded and not smokingAllowed  
```  
  
 \- OR -  
  
```  
$filter=parkingIncluded eq true and smokingAllowed eq false  
```  
  
 Find all hotels that are Luxury or include parking and have a rating of 5:  
  
```  
$filter=(category eq 'Luxury' or parkingIncluded eq true) and rating eq 5  
```  
  
 Find all hotels with the tag "wifi" (where each hotel has tags stored in a Collection(Edm.String) field):  
  
```  
$filter=tags/any(t: t eq 'wifi')  
```  
  
 Find all hotels without the tag "motel":  
  
```  
$filter=tags/all(t: t ne 'motel')  
```  
  
 Find all hotels with any tags:  
  
```  
$filter=tags/any()  
```  
  
 Find all hotels within 10 kilometers of a given reference point (where location is a field of type Edm.GeographyPoint):  
  
```  
$filter=geo.distance(location, geography'POINT(-122.131577 47.678581)') le 10  
```  
  
 Find all hotels within a given viewport described as a polygon (where location is a field of type Edm.GeographyPoint). Note that the polygon is closed (the first and last point sets must be the same) and [the points must be listed in counterclockwise order](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798938.aspx#Anchor_1).
  
```  
$filter=geo.intersects(location, geography'POLYGON((-122.031577 47.578581, -122.031577 47.678581, -122.131577 47.678581, -122.031577 47.578581))')  
```  
  
 Find all hotels that either have no value in "description" field, or that value is explicitly set to null:  
  
```  
$filter=description eq null  
```
