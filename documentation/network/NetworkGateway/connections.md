# Connections
The Connection resource represents a connection between two gateways. One of the gateways in the connection must be a virtual network gateway, but the other gateway could be another virtual network gateway, a local network gateway, or a dedicated circuit.  
  
## Common parameters and headers  
 The following information is common to all tasks that you might do related to connections:  
  
-   Replace {api-version} with 2015-05-01-preview.  
  
-   Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription identifier in the URI.  
  
-   Replace {resource-group-name} with the name of the resource group. For more information, see [Using Resource groups to manage your Azure resources](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-preview-portal-using-resource-groups/).  
  
-   Replace {virtual-network-gateway-name} with the name of the virtual network gateway.  
  
-   Set the Content-Type header to `application/json`.  
  
-   Set the Authorization header to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](../Topic/Authenticating%20Azure%20Resource%20Manager%20requests.md).  
  
-   Replace {connection-name} with the name of the connection.
