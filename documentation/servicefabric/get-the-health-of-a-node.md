# Get the health of a node
Gets the health of a Service Fabric node.  
  
## Request  
 See [Node](node.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to nodes.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a node:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI gets the health of a node with events filter:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Nodes/{node-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}& EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the node based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx) . Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](status-and-error-codes1.md).

|------------------|-----------------|  
|HealthEvents|The health events as an array of JSON objects.|  
|SourceId|The source of the health event as a string.|  
|Property|The property as a string.|  
|HealthState|The health state.<br /><br /> Possible values are:<br /><br /> -   Invalid - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.<br />-   Ok - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.<br />-   Warning - Indicates the health status is at a warning level. The value is 2.<br />-   Indicated the health status is at an error level. The value is 3.<br />-   Unknown - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.|  
|TimeToLiveInMilliSeconds|The time for this health report to be valid in milliseconds. If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value. To explicitly set Infinite time to live, use value “922337203685477”.|  
|Description|The health state description. The maximum string length for the description is 4096 characters.|  
|SequenceNumber|The sequence number for this health report as a numeric string. If not specified, a sequence number is auto-generated by the health client.|
