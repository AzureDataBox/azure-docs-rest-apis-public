# Get the health of a cluster by using a health policy
Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster.  
  
## Request  
 See [Common parameters and headers](../ServiceFabricREST/cluster.md#bk_common) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to the cluster.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|POST|The following URI evaluates the cluster health:<br />`<URI>/$/GetClusterHealth?api-version=2.0`|  
|POST|The following URI evaluates the cluster health with events filter: <br />`<URI>$/GetClusterHealth?api-version=2.0&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
|POST|The following URI evaluates the cluster health and applies filters for events, nodes and applications: <br />`<URI>$/GetClusterHealth?api-version=2.0& NodesHealthStateFilter={ NodesHealthStateFilter}&ApplicationsHealthStateFilter={ApplicationsHealthStateFilter}& EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the cluster based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx). Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {NodesHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of NodeHealthState objects. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only nodes that match the filter will be returned. All nodes will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {ApplicationsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of ApplicationHealthState objects. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only applications that match the filter will be returned. All applications will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   ClusterHealthPolicy which describes the health policy used to evaluate the cluster and nodes. If not present, the health evaluation uses the health policy from cluster manifest or the default health policy. ClusterHealthPolicy fields:  
  
    ```  
    {  
            "ConsiderWarningAsError": false|true,  
            "MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes": <value>,  
            "MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications": <value>  
            "ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap":[{"Key":"<value>","Value":<value>}]  
    }  
  
    ```  
  
|Element Name|Required|Type|Description|  
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|ConsiderWarningAsError|Yes|Boolean|Determines whether warnings should be treated with the same severity as errors. Value of `true` to treat warnings as errors; `false` to not treat warnings as errors.|  
|MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes|Yes|Number|The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.|  
|MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications|Yes|Number|The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.|  
|ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap|Yes||Specifies the map that defines the maximum percentage of unhealthy applications that are allowed per application type. Application types in this map are evaluated using specific percentages rather than the global *MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications* percentage.  For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures). All other applications can be evaluated with *MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications* set to 20% to tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances. The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for **HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation**.|  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](../ServiceFabricREST/status-and-error-codes1.md).

    string responseString = string.Empty;  
  
    // Create the request and add URL parameters.  
    Uri requestUri = new Uri(clusterUri, string.Format("/$/GetClusterHealth?api-version={0}",  
        "1.0")); // api-version  
  
    HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(requestUri);  
    request.Method = "POST";  
    request.ContentLength = 0;  
  
    // Execute the request and obtain the response.
