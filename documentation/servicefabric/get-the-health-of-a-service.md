# Get the health of a service
Gets the health reports of a Service Fabric service  
  
## Request  
 See [Service](../ServiceFabricREST/service.md) for headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to services.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|The following URI is used to get the health of a service:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Applications/{application-name}/$/GetServices/{service-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI is used to get the health of a service:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Services/{service-name}/$/GetHealth?api-version={api-version}`|  
|GET|The following URI is used to get the health of a service with filters for events and partitions:<br /><br /> `<URI>/Services/{service-name}/$/GetHealth? EventsHealthStateFilter={ EventsHealthStateFilter}& PartitionsHealthStateFilter={ PartitionsHealthStateFilter}&api-version={api-version}`|  
  
-   Use {EventsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the service  based on health state. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of [HealthStateFilter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.health.healthstatefilter.aspx). Only events that match the filter will be returned. All events will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
-   Use {PartitionsHealthStateFilter} (optional) to filter the collection of PartitionHealthState objects children of the service. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only partitions that match the filter will be returned. All partitions will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned. Possible values are:  
  
    -   Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.  
  
    -   None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.  
  
    -   Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.  
  
    -   Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.  
  
    -   Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.  
  
    -   All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.  
  
## Response  
 A successful operation will return 200 OK. For information on error codes, see [Status and Error Codes](../ServiceFabricREST/status-and-error-codes1.md).
