# Databases
  The DocumentDB REST API supports basic CRUD operations on the resources under a database account. This topic outlines the operations that can be executed on a DocumentDB database.  
  
 Each DocumentDB account supports multiple independent named databases. A database is a logical container of document storage, partitioned across collections. A database is also a container of users. It is a system resource and thus contains a fixed schema representing the construct of a database. The database resource is represented by **dbs** in the [DocumentDB resource model](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-resources/). Hereâ€™s an example of the URI: https://mydbaccount.documents.azure.com/dbs.  
  
 The following example illustrates the JSON construct of a database:  
  
```  
{  
 "id":"ContosoDB",  
 "_rid":"rnYYAA==",  
 "_ts":1408056022,  
 "_self":"dbs\/rnYYAA==\/",  
 "_etag":"00004800-0000-0000-0000-53ed3ad60000",  
"_colls":"colls\/",  
"_users":"users\/"  
}  
  
```  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|id|Required. This is the only [user settable property](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-resources/#system-vs-user-defined-resources). It is a unique name that identifies the database, i.e. no two databases will share the same name in an account. The name must not exceed 255 characters.|  
|_rid|This is a [system generated property](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/documentdb-resources/#system-vs-user-defined-resources). The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the database.|  
|_ts|This is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|_self|This is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|_etag|This is a system generated property that specifies the resource etag required for optimistic concurrency control.|  
|_colls|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the **collections** resource.|  
|_users|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the **users** resource.|  
  
## Tasks  
 You can do the following with databases:  
  
-   [Create a Database](create-a-database.md)  
  
-   [List Databases](list-databases.md)  
  
-   [Get a Database](get-a-database.md)  
  
-   [Delete a Database retired](../Topic/Delete%20a%20Database%20retired.md)
